> > If a square matrix satisfies A = AT, it is called symmetric. We denote the set of all symmetric matrices of size n as Sn.

> > A tensor (in machine learning terminology) is just a generalization of a 2d array to more than 2 dimensions

> > The number of dimensions is known as the order or rank of the tensor

> [!PDF|yellow] [[murphy2022.pdf#page=259&selection=82,11,91,55&color=yellow|murphy2022, p.229]]
> >  we can reshape a vector into a matrix. There are two choices for how to do this, known as row-major order (used by languages such as Python and C++) and column-major order (used by languages such as Julia, Matlab, R and Fortran

> > A vector space is a collection of such vectors, which can be added together, and scaled by scalars (1-dimensional numbers), in order to create new points.

> > A set of vectors {x1, x2, . . . xn} is said to be (linearly) independent if no vector can be represented as a linear combination of the remaining vectors

> [!PDF|yellow] [[murphy2022.pdf#page=260&selection=257,0,287,1&color=yellow|murphy2022, p.230]]
> > The span of a set of vectors {x1, x2, . . . , xn} is the set of all vectors that can be expressed as a linear combination of {x1, . . . , xn}.

> > A basis B is a set of linearly independent vectors that spans the whole space, meaning that span (B) = Rn. There are often multiple bases to choose from

> > A linear map or linear transformation is any function f : V → W such that f (v + w) = f (v) + f (w) and f (a v) = a f (v) for all v, w ∈ V
