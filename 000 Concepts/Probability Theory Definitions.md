# Probability Theory Definitions

Before we mathematically define **probability**, it is worth discussing the meaning or interpretation of probability. Several definitions or interpretations of probability have been proposed, starting from the classical definition by Laplace, and including the limiting frequency, the subjective, the logical, and the propensity interpretations:
- **Classical**: probability has to do with equiprobable events; if a certain experiment has $N$ possible outcomes, the probability of each outcome is $1 / N$.
- **Logical**: probability is a measure of rational belief; that is, according to the available evidence, a rational person will have a certain belief regarding an event, which will define its probability.  
- **Subjective**: probability is a measure of the personal degree of belief in a certain event; this could be measured in terms of a betting factor - the probability of a certain event for an individual is related to how much that person is willing to bet on that event.
- **Frequency**: probability is a measure of the number of occurrences of an event given a certain experiment, when the number of repetitions of the experiment tends to infinity.
- **Propensity**: probability is a measure of the number of occurrences of an event under repeatable conditions, even if the experiment only occurs once.

These interpretations can be grouped into what are the two main approaches in probability and statistics:
- Objective (classical, frequency, propensity): probabilities exist in the real world and can be measured.
- Epistemological (logical, subjective, bayesian): probabilities have to do with human knowledge, they are measures of belief. (Sucar, 2021, p. 15)
