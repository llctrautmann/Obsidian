# Nuclear Reactors
## Introduction 
- Nov. 10th 1938 (night of Broken Glass, Fermi gets nobel Prize)
- Fermi is the luckiest Nobel Prize holder
	- Shooting Neutrons at Uranium to find Element 93 and 94
	- In reality he discovered Nuclear Fission (Krypton + Barium)
	- By accident he claimed the discovery of two new elements but invented "Nuclear fission" a tech that dominated the 20th century.
