# Nuclear Reactors
## Introduction 
- Nov. 10th 1938 (night of Broken Glass, Fermi gets nobel Prize)
- Fermi is the luckiest Nobel Prize holder
	- Shooting Neutrons at Uranium to find Element 93 and 94
	- In reality he discovered Nuclear Fission (Krypton + Barium)
	- By accident he claimed the discovery of two new elements but invented "Nuclear fission" a tech that dominated the 20th century. 


## The most important thing for a Nuclear Power Plant Operator

$$
R R=\Phi \cdot \Sigma=\Phi \cdot \mathrm{N} \cdot \sigma \text { or } \mathrm{RR}=\int_0^{\infty} \Sigma(\mathrm{E}) \cdot \Phi(\mathrm{E}) \mathrm{dE}
$$

## Why do we need Heavy Water? 
[Add fission plot]
- 
- Hydrogen same mass as neutron (1 both) 
	- loss all coolant, the reaction will stop
	- RMBK (graphite)
