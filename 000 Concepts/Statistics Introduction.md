# Statistics Introduction
## Introduction
- Statistics describes a technique ("__training__") that makes it possible to learn the parameter of a distribution from data[^1]. 
- The basic description of training is an optimisation problem

## Formal Definitions
- The basic description of training is an optimisation problem given by:

$$\large\tag{1}
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}=\underset{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\operatorname{argmin}} \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta})
$$
- $\mathcal{L}$ here is a loss function that condenses the problem into a scalar problem.


## Noteworthy
- In statistics, the process of _quantifying uncertainty about an unknown quantity estimated from a finite sample of data is called_ **inference**.
