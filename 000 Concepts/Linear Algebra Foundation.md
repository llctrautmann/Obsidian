# Linear Algebra Foundation
A vector is only a vector in the mathematical sense if it conforms with two requirements:

1. Adding a vector to another vector needs to result in another vector
2. multiplying two vectors also need to result in another vector

> Note: Hence polynomials are also vectors. Same as Audio files (more in [[Audio Processing Introduction]] )

This is important for any machine learning application. In [[Parameterisating Conditional Distributions with Neural Networks]] we can see why these things are important for [[Model Training in Machine Learning]].
