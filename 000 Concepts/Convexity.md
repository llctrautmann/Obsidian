# Convexity
- Pertains to sets and [[Functions]] 
- For functions, there are degrees of convexity.
	- do they exist, are they unique, how quickly can we find them using optimization algorithms

- mathematically we can show that convex functions follow
$$
t \mathbf{x}+(1-t) \mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{X}
$$
- Geometrically, it just means that all points on a line between two points are all in the set. 
- Convexity makes optimisation easier or in some cases is necessary for optimisation to be possible.
