# Probability as an Extension of Boolean Logic

## Intro and Background
Probability theory is rooted in set theory as outlined in the [[000 Background Probability Theory|fundamentals]]. 

The most important thing to understand is:
- Events are sets in the sample space. 
- These sets need to be transformed into numbers between 0 and 1. 
- This transformation requires some guardrails which is the sigma algebra
- A probability distribution defined by Kolmogorov's axioms is completely specified by the probability triplet $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$
- In such cases we always assume a valid $\sigma$-algebra underlying the entire thing to exclude ill-formed sets. Condensed into symbols the entire derivation of then fundamentals of probability theory can be can be summarised with the following symbols:

$$\Large\tag{1}(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$$
- $\Omega$ is the sample space
- $\mathcal{F}$ is the sigma algebra
- $\mathbb{P}$ is the probability measure

## An Event
An event can be any occurance or statement like the following:

- _"Tomorrow it will rain."_

## Probability of an Event
We denote a probability as $P(\cdot)$. For example the probability that the event $A$ = _"Tomorrow it will rain."_ occurs is $P(A)$.   
## Basic Probability Rules
From the above-mentioned background there are three main cases that need to be covered [^1]:
1. **Intersection**
	1. Independent: $P(A \cap B) \triangleq  P(A) \cdot P(B)$
	2. Dependent: $P(A \cap B) \triangleq P(A) \cdot P(B|A) = P(B) \cdot P(A|B)$
2. **Union**
	1. Non-exclusive: $P(A \cup B) \triangleq  P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
	2. Mutually exclusive: $\operatorname{Pr}(A \cup B)=\operatorname{Pr}(A)+\operatorname{Pr}(B)$
3. **Condition**: $\operatorname{Pr}(B \mid A) \triangleq \frac{\operatorname{Pr}(A, B)}{\operatorname{Pr}(A)}$ 

## Probabilities of Multiple Event 
### Conjunction
If we have two events $A$ and $B$ the __joint probability__ is defined as:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \quad \text{if independent}$$
and:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A) = P(B) \cdot P(A|B)\quad \text{if dependent}$$
where $P(A \cap B)$ denotes the probability of both event A and event B occurring, and $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the individual probabilities of events A and B, respectively. $P(B|A)$ is the conditional probability of B 'given' A.

### Joint Probability 

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$

where $P(A \cup B)$ denotes the probability of event A or event B occurring (or both), $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the individual probabilities of events A and B, respectively, and $P(A \cap B)$ is the probability of both A and B occurring. 
- The same formula is used in the dimensionality of [[Vectors Subspaces#Dimensionality of Combined Subspaces|subspaces]]. 
Note that if events A and B are mutually exclusive (i.e., cannot occur at the same time), then $P(A \cap B) = 0$, and the formula simplifies to:

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$
