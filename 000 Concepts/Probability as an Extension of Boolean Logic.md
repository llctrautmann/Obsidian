# Probability as an Extension of Boolean Logic

## Intro and Background
Probability theory is rooted in set theory as outlined in the [[000 Background Probability Theory|fundamentals]]. 

The most important thing to understand is:
- A probability distribution defined by Kolmogorov's axioms is completely specified by the probability triplet $(\mathbf{X}, \mathcal{F}, \pi)$ which is often denoted more compactly as $$\mathrm{X} \sim \pi$$and reads itself as "X distributed by $\pi$". In such cases we always assume a valid $\sigma$-algebra underlying the entire thing. Condensed into symbols the entire derivation of then fundamentals of probability theory can be can be summarised with the following symbols:$$\left [\Omega, \mathcal{F}_{\sigma}, X^{-1}, X_{\mathbb{R}}, \mathbb{P}_{[0,1]} \right ]$$


## An Event
An event can be any occurance or statement like the following:

- _"Tomorrow it will rain."_

## Probability of an Event
We denote a probability as $P(\cdot)$. For example the probability that the event $A$ = _"Tomorrow it will rain."_ occurs is $P(A)$.
