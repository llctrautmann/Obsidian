# Quotes

- You cannot use smoke signals to do philosophy. Its form excludes its content. 
- The telegraph recreates news as a commodity 
- every two we create in bed an idea that goes beyond the function of a thing itself. It has been pointed out, for example, that the invention of eyeglasses in the 12th century it only made it possible to improve effective vision, but suggested the idea that human beings need not to accept as a final, either the endowment of nature, nor the ravages of Time.
- Even such an instrument as the microscope, hardly of everyday use, had embedded within its acquired astonishing idea, not about biology, but about psychology by revealing a world, two, and hidden from the view, the microscope suggested of possibility about the structure of the mind
- I have remained steadfast to [McLuhan’s], teaching that the clearest way to see through culture is to attend its tool for conversation

## Chapter 2 media as Epistemology

- but to the modern mind, resonating with different media metaphors, the truth and economics is believed to be best, discovered, and expressed in numbers.
- I hope to persuade you that the decline of a print based epistemology, and the accompanying rise of television based etymology has had grave consequences for public life that we are getting cilia by the minute and that is why is necessary for me to drive hard, the point that the weight assigned to any former truth telling is a function of the influence of media of communication. “seeing as believing”has always had a preeminence status as an epistemological axiom, but “saying is believing”,” reading is believing”, “counting is believing”, “deducing is believing”, and “feeling is believing” are others, that they have written or fallen in importance as cultures have undergone media change. __(This is in response to examples that previous cultures have use these types of epistemology with the believe that they are perfectly rational. Like we are today, using scientific method and believe that is perfectly rational. Showing thereby, that it is important to look at the current model of sense-making in a society to understand it.)__
- I will say once again that I’m not a relative in this matter, and that I believe the epistemology created by television not only is inferior to print based epistemology, but is dangerous and absurdist.
- The epistemology of new forms such as television does not have an entirely unchallenged influence. I find it useful to think of the situation in this way changes in the symbolic environment, and like changes in the natural environment they are both gradual and additive at first, and then all at once a critical mass is achieved as the physicist say. A river that has slowly been polluted suddenly becomes toxic; most the fish parish; swimming becomes a danger to health. But even then, the river may look the same, and one may still take a boat right on it. In other words, even when life has been taken from it, the river does not disappear, nor all of its uses, but it has been seriously diminished, and it’s degraded condition will have harmful effects throughout the landscape. It is this way with our symbolic environment. 
- In the analogy I’ve drawn above, the river, refers, largely to what we called public discourse, our political, religious informational, and commercial forms of conversation. I am arguing that a television based epistemology pollutes public communication and its surrounding landscape not that it’s pollutes everything.
