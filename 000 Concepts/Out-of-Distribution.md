# Out-of-Distribution

Out-of-distribution describes images, that are not positions on the [manifold](Manifold%20Hypothesis) and lie therefore outside of the range of the model. 

`This is somewhat like Dr. House. The entire show was basically an hommage to out-of-distribution medical cases. But in more general terms, I think a good way to think about this would my brothers appendix, which was symptomatically an Out-of-Distribution event.` 


This usually leads to bad classification results and requires careful [[Uncertainty Quantification]]
