# Letter of Intent

To whom it may concern,

I am writing you to express my intentions in working for your company as [insert job title]. 

I am bringing with me deep knowledge in machine learning and deep learning applications. 


I also briefly want to explain my motivation to apply for this opportunity. For the past decade I was intent on staying within academia, partially driven by my deep fascination for science and partly driven but my desire to express my ideas and thoughts freely protected under the fundamental "Grundsatz" that science should be free. 
However, the developments within machine learning and AI more broadly since the development of the transformer architecture in 2018, have made it clear that universities in the future will not be able to provide the amount of compute necessary for large network architectures. I therefore have made the painful decision to move away form scientific research and instead try to make an impact within the private sector. 
This decision has come with some ramifications. While I do bring with me experience in scientific research across multiple fields and organisations, I do not bring with me a large amount of experience in the private sector. I therefore hope that I can convince you of my skill and work ethic based on my academic performance alone. 
Secondly,
