# Subspaces
[[Vector Spaces]] can contain smaller spaces that do follow all rules necessary for being their own space. Important examples are the: 

1) [[Column Space]]
2) [[Null Space]]
3) [[Row Space]] 

## Conditions
If $V$ is a vector space, then $S \subseteq V$ is said to be a subspace of $V$ if

1) $\mathbf{0} \in S$
2) $S$ is closed under addition: $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in S$ implying $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y} \in S$
3) $S$ is closed under scalar multiplication: $\mathbf{x} \in S, ~ \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ implies $\alpha \mathbf{x} \in S$
