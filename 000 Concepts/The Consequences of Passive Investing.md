# Summary
The rise of passive investing over the past 30 has revolutionised the way investors obtain exposure to the worlds equity markets. The introduction of index funds as far back as the 1970s and more recently, the rise of exchange-traded funds since the 1990s has provided a cost effective way for institutions and individual investors alike to participate in financial markets without the need for the traditionally more costly active managers.

The flow of funds into investment vehicles has skewed towards passive (in the form of ETFs) at the expense of managed funds (who are predominately actively managed). This trend has been particularly noticeable over the past five years.

The fundamental basis behind passive investing becoming the primary way investors allocate capital has been easy to justify and rightfully so. Ultra-low fees, simplicity, tax-advantages (via ETFs) and of course superior investment returns relative to actively managed funds. Whilst the appeal of passive investing is hard to ignore, there is an increasing number of fundamental issues with passive investing itself of which most investors are not aware or are ignorant of. The general theory behind passive stems from the efficient market hypothesis, theorizing that current prices of securities reflects all available information (i.e. the market is efficient), and thus active managers are not able to beat the market if they are using publicly available information.

The idea of passive investing being “price-takers” and are thus having no impact on market prices is ridiculous. Whilst it is true this would be the case if the passive vehicles were already holding the market portfolio and were not receiving any inflows or outflows of capital, we can see [...] this is not the case. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Passive is only passive if it is not buying or selling. Passive investment vehicles are continuing to see inflows, which, as passive investment vehicles are fully invested at all times, means they must be buyers of securities.</mark> 

What passive managers truly are, are large institutional active quantitative managers with absurdly simple systematic rules.

This increased level of correlation among securities raises issues regarding diversification for equity investors. If an equity portfolio consisting of 30 or so companies was once considered diversified, given they now are increasingly priced as a group during periods of increased volatility (a time when diversification is needed most) due to the rise of passive, we must reconsider how diversified equity portfolios truly are. 

One of the roles of discretionary active managers within markets has historically been to allocate capital to business’s whose fundamentals, prospects and valuations are deemed favourable and expected to generate future economic growth. For the most part, we would expect active managers to be more willing to allocate capital to companies who are cheap relative to their fundamentals, and less willing to allocate capital to companies that are expensive relative to their fundamentals and whose prospects are poor. This fundamental based price discovery aspect of the markets is not present within passive strategies, and will increasingly be less present in the markets as passive continues to gain market share.

As long as the flows in exceed the flows out, price theoretically can rise (or fall) exponentially. So long as the passive inflows exceed the outflows from both passive and active vehicles, this would result in a constant bid being present for securities.

The key as to how this may unwind is at which point in time the selling pressure from the retirees exceeds the inflows into passive vehicles. Due to this demographic feature of how capital is allocated and how a significantly greater share of financial assets is owned by the retirees, there will likely come a point in time where the outflows will overwhelm the inflows. Until then, there is no telling how high the constant bid of passive can push asset prices and the level of volatility we may see along the way.
