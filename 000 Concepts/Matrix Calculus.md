# Matrix Calculus

We are fundamentally dealing with rate of change in calculus[^1]. 

## Derivatives
his measures how quickly the output changes when we move a small distance in input space away from x [^2].
$$ \Large\tag{1}
f^{\prime}(x) \triangleq \lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\int(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$

- In the classical understanding the derivative is the slope of the tangent at the point. 
- In line with [[Norms in Linear Algebra|norms]], or [[Metrics]] the derivative is also a mapping
	- linking functions to functions: $\large D(f)=f'$ [^3] 
	- Leibnitz notation: $\frac{d y}{d x}$
