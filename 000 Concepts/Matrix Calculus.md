# Matrix Calculus

We are fundamentally dealing with rate of change in calculus[^1]. 

## Derivatives
his measures how quickly the output changes when we move a small distance in input space away from x [^2].
$$ \Large\tag{1}
f^{\prime}(x) \triangleq \lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\int(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$

- In the classical understanding the derivative is the slope of the tangent at the point. 
- In line with [[Norms in Linear Algebra|norms]], or [[Metrics]] the derivative is also a mapping
	- linking functions to functions: $\large D(f)=f'$ [^3] 
	- Leibnitz notation: $\frac{d y}{d x}$ 

## Gradients
Gradients are the extension of the derivative to vector functions [^4]. The gradient is then just the set of partial derivatives stacked. 

$$ \large\tag{2}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f\left(\boldsymbol{x}+h \boldsymbol{e}_i\right)-f(\boldsymbol{x})}{h}
$$
- $\mathbf{e}_{i}$ is the basis vector 

This results in the $\large\nabla$: 
$$ \large\tag{3} 
\boldsymbol{g}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial \boldsymbol{x}}=\nabla f=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}
\end{array}\right)
$$

- In case of a vector function the gradient describes a **vector field**, for scalar functions a **scalar field**
