# What does the expression $\mathbb{E}[f] \simeq \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N f(x_n)$ represent?

The expression $\mathbb{E}[f] \simeq \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N f(x_n)$ represents the approximation of the expected value (or mean) of a function $f(x)$ over a random variable $x$. Instead of computing the expected value using an integral or sum, it can be approximated by taking the average of $f(x_n)$ over $N$ samples $x_n$ drawn from the distribution of $x$. The approximation becomes more accurate as $N$ increases.
