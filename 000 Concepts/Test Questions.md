# What are the hallmarks of a bijection?
injectivity/one-to-one mapping and surjectivity/onto mapping
1. Each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain, meaning no two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain. 
2. Every element in the codomain has a corresponding element in the domain, ensuring that the function covers the entire codomain.
