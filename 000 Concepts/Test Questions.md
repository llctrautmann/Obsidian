# Variance 
---
- Variance measures the spread or dispersion of a set of values in a distribution. It's calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. A higher variance indicates a wider spread of values.
- There is a useful trick to remember:
  - $\operatorname{var}[f]=\mathbb{E}\left[(f(x)-\mathbb{E}[f(x)])^2\right] \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum(y-\mu)^2$ (sample variance).
  - $\operatorname{var}[x]=\mathbb{E}\left[x^2\right]-\mathbb{E}[x]^2$
- Variance is denoted by $\sigma^2$ for population variance and $s^2$ for sample variance.
