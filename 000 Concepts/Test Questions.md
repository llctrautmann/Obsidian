# What is Bayes' rule used for in statistics? 
---
Bayes' rule relates the conditional probability of an event given new evidence to the prior probability of the event and the likelihood of the new evidence.

# How is the posterior probability computed using Bayes' rule? 
---
The posterior probability is computed as $P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$.

# What does the likelihood represent in Bayesian statistics? 
---
The likelihood represents the probability of the observed data given the parameters of the model.

# How do you calculate the likelihood for a dataset assuming the samples are independent? 
---
You calculate the likelihood as the product of the likelihoods for each individual sample: $P(x | \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i | \theta)$.

# What is the purpose of the prior distribution in Bayes' rule? 
---
The prior distribution represents your beliefs about the parameters before observing any data.

# How is the posterior distribution obtained using the prior and likelihood? 
---
The posterior distribution is obtained by multiplying the likelihood by the prior and then normalizing with the evidence: $P(\theta | x) = \frac{P(x | \theta) \cdot P(\theta)}{P(x)}$.

# Why might a uniform prior not always be appropriate? 
---
A uniform prior might not reflect prior knowledge, constraints on the parameter space, or provide computational convenience.

# What is a conjugate prior and why is it used? 
---
A conjugate prior is one that, when combined with a likelihood function, results in a posterior distribution of the same family. It is used for computational convenience.

# Can the prior be a set of distributions similar to the likelihoods for each data point? 
---
No, the prior is a single distribution over the parameters and is not multiplied with each likelihood. Instead, it scales the likelihood to obtain the posterior.

# What should you do if you have specific knowledge about parameter values rather than using a uniform prior? 
---
You should use an informative prior that incorporates your specific knowledge or empirical evidence about the parameter values.
