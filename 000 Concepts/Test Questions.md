# What are the hallmarks of a bijection?
injectivity/one-to-one mapping and surjectivity/onto mapping
1. Each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain, meaning no two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain. 
2. Every element in the codomain has a corresponding element in the domain, ensuring that the function covers the entire codomain.
# What is the connection between eigenvalues and the trace of a matrix? 
the trace is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues. 
$$
\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A})=\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i
$$

# What is the connection between eigenvalues and the determinant of a matrix? 
The determinant of $\mathbf{A}$ is equal to the product of its eigenvalues,
$$
\operatorname{det}(\mathbf{A})=\prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i
$$
