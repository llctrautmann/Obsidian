# What is the probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution?

**A:** The PDF of a normal distribution is given by:
$$\mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu)^2\right\}$$



# What are the two parameters that define a normal distribution?

**A:** A normal distribution is defined by two parameters: 
- $\mu$ (mean)
- $\sigma^2$ (variance)



# What is the standard deviation in a normal distribution?

**A:** The standard deviation in a normal distribution is $\sigma$.



# What is the precision in a normal distribution?

**A:** The precision in a normal distribution is $\frac{1}{\sigma}$.



# How does the normal distribution relate to the concept of maximum entropy?

**A:** The normal distribution arises naturally from the concept of maximum entropy.



# How does the normal distribution relate to the central limit theorem?

**A:** The normal distribution arises naturally from the perspective of the central limit theorem.



# Is the normal distribution always non-negative?

**A:** Yes, the normal distribution is always non-negative:
$$\mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu, \sigma^2) > 0$$



# What is the integral of the normal distribution over all possible values of $x$?

**A:** The integral of the normal distribution over all possible values of $x$ is:
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu, \sigma^2) dx = 1$$
