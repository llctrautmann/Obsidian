Sure, here's a prompt for a Language Learning Model (LLM) to extract information from a stack of PDF files and create Anki cards in the specified format:

---

**Prompt:**

You are provided with a collection of PDF files containing educational content. Your task is to extract key information from these files and convert it into Anki flashcards. Each flashcard should be formatted as follows:

```
# <Question>

---

<Answer>
```

Follow these steps:

1. **Extract Information**: Read through each PDF file carefully and identify important facts, concepts, definitions, or any other significant information that can be used to create a question-answer pair.

2. **Create Questions**: Formulate questions based on the extracted information. The questions should be clear, concise, and focused on a single piece of information.

3. **Provide Answers**: Write accurate and concise answers to the questions you have formulated. Ensure that the answers directly address the questions posed.

4. **Format Flashcards**: Ensure each flashcard is formatted correctly with the question at the top, followed by a separator line (---), and the answer below it.

### Example:

If the content in the PDF discusses the process of photosynthesis, a possible flashcard could be:

```
# What is the primary function of chlorophyll in photosynthesis?

---

Chlorophyll primarily functions to absorb light, usually sunlight, to convert it into chemical energy during photosynthesis.
```

### Output Requirements:

- Each flashcard must be complete and self-contained.
- Maintain accuracy and clarity in both questions and answers.
- Include enough context in the questions to make them understandable without referring back to the source material.

### PDF Files:

The PDF files are stored in a folder named `PDF_Documents`. Begin by processing each file in this folder and generating the corresponding Anki cards.

---

**Instructions to LLM:**

- Use the information from the PDF files stored in the folder.
- Ensure the extracted content is relevant and accurate.
- Generate a sufficient number of flashcards to cover the key points in each PDF.

Begin the task now and provide the output in the specified format.
