# Lehman Brother Autopsy

> While numerous factors contributed to Lehman’s demise, the immediate cause was collateral calls by Lehman’s clearing banks, chiefly JPMorgan.


[...] in early 2007, Lehman management viewed the incipient financial crisis as an opportunity for the firm to gain market share and revenue from competitors that were retrenching and lowering their risk profiles

Lehman’s pace of principal investments in commercial real estate, leveraged loans, and private equity increased in the first half of 2007 as other security firms reduced risk and hunkered down.[7] It committed 11 billion of that in October when it couldn’t find enough buyers to take it out of its commitment.[8] Other bridge loans and bridge equity positions also became similarly stuck on its balance sheet.

To take on these risky assets, Lehman’s management raised all its internal risk limits: firm-wide, line-of-business, and even single-name risk limits.


Not only were these investments risky from the perspective of potential market value losses; they were risky from the point of view of financing.

`Note: The financing part is much more important.`

By their nature, real estate, leveraged loans, and private equity are hard to value and less liquid.

`Note: Gaussian Coppola`

If lenders worry about the realizable value of assets offered as loan security, they will lower the amount they will lend against those assets or cease lending against them altogether. Most of Lehman’s secured debt had overnight tenors, so lenders could stop rolling over their loans to Lehman on any business day!

`Note: This was pretty normal back in the days. Most of the transaction in the working eurodollar system was financed through Repo.`

Lehman’s management touted the firm’s “liquidity pool,” the sum of cash and assets readily convertible into cash and as late as two days before bankruptcy claimed this pool equaled 41 billion of those assets were readily monetisable.

From January to May 2008, while its competitors raised equity, Lehman did not.[21] Lehman’s management rejected offers from interested investors because they did not want to issue equity at a discount to market price.[22] **Management thought doing so would make the firm seem vulnerable.**

`Note: Maybe this is somewhat related to the discount window aversion`

## Intraday Liquidity
JPMorgan extended intraday liquidity to Lehman owing to it being Lehman’s principal clearing bank, including providing Lehman with highly significant **tri-party repo clearing**.

`There it is.`

The classic repo example is an overnight agreement backed by US Treasury securities, although Lehman financed an array of securities using repo, sometimes over longer tenors. The classic repo counterparties are a money market fund seeking to invest cash overnight and a security firm seeking to finance its securities inventory.
Tri-party repo was introduced in the 1980s to reduce the risk of repo transactions. In tri-party repo, a clearing bank such as JPMorgan steps between the parties and intermediates their transaction, making sure the deliveries of security and cash occur simultaneously. To facilitate a smooth transfer, the security stays in JPMorgan’s custody and JPMorgan makes a bookkeeping entry in its records to change the security’s ownership.

JPMorgan’s response to the Fed was to revamp the way it calculated its intraday exposure limits to broker-dealers. Previously, JPMorgan summed the value of collateral it held from broker-dealers. From this sum JPMorgan subtracted the net cash advances it made on broker-dealers’ behalf. This number was tracked throughout the day as old repos settled, as new repos were put on, and as securities were bought and sold. The result should always be positive: collateral value minus cash advances should be greater than zero.

Looking back, it seems odd the JPMorgan and BNY Mellon did not deduct margin from collateral value in their exposure calculations before the Fed’s encouragement. But in February JPMorgan told its broker-dealer customers that collateral value in its intraday exposure calculation would be reduced by two margin amounts.

Also on 9 September, JPMorgan determined that it needed a “master-master” collateral agreement. This agreement would allow excess collateral under the clearing master agreement to offset a collateral shortfall under the derivatives master agreement, and vice versa. It also brought certain unsecured credit lines under the collateral agreement. Citi also tightened its collateral agreements with Lehman this week. JPMorgan insisted that the $5 billion of collateral be posted and the master-master be signed by the open on 10 September.

`Note: Being sucked bone-dry`

If Lehman did not accede to JPMorgan’s demands, JPMorgan wielded a very heavy stick. Without a clearing bank, Lehman could not finance itself with repos. In its situation, it was not going to be able to take its clearing business elsewhere, so losing JPMorgan as its clearer meant certain bankruptcy.

By Friday 12 September, JPMorgan was done asking for collateral. It and Lehman’s other clearing banks had probably already extracted virtually all Lehman’s available collateral, anyway. My strong sense is that JPMorgan made clear to regulators that it was not going to clear for Lehman if Monday arrived without a permanent solution to Lehman’s problem.
