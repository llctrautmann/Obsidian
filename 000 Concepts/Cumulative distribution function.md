# Cummulative distribution function

$$ \Large\tag{1}
P(y) \triangleq \operatorname{Pr}(Y \leq y)
$$

- This translates to: see [^1]
- CDFs are monotonically non-decreasing functions. 

## Calculating probabilities
- Any probability for a value $y$ is given by a range between an upper limit and a lower limit.

$$\large\tag{2}
\operatorname{Pr}(a<Y \leq b)=P(b)-P(a)
$$



# Footnotes

[^1]: Let P(y) be defined as the probability that the random variable Y is less than or equal to y
