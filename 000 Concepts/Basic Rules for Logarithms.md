# Basic Rules for Calculations with Logarithms
## Rule 1: Product Rule
The logarithm of a product is equal to the sum of the logarithms of its factors. That is, for any positive numbers $a$ and $b$:
$$
log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)
$$

## Rule 2: Quotient Rule
The logarithm of a quotient is equal to the difference of the logarithms of its terms. That is, for any positive numbers $a$ and $b$:
$$
log\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = log(a) - log(b)
$$

## Rule 3: Power Rule
The logarithm of a power is equal to the product of the exponent and the logarithm of the base. That is, for any positive numbers $a$ and $b$:
$$
log(a^b) = b \cdot log(a)
$$

## Rule 4: Change of Base Rule
The logarithm of a number in one base can be expressed as the logarithm of the same number in another base. That is, for any positive numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$:
$$
log_c(a) = \frac{log_b(a)}{log_b(c)}
$$
