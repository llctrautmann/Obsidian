# The Focus Problem | In search of Deep Work

> First step in solving a problem is identifying one as such. My life's distractions are preventing me from achieving progress in my life. So I need to get better at managing this addictive behaviour. 
> 

I want to be successful and I want to be able to achieve my academic and career aspirations. 

__The problem is that I am distracted and addicted to unproductive behavioural patterns that prevent me from performing quality work in time.__ 

There are major components that are most distracting to me. There are ordered here in the amount of time they are taking away from me:

1. __Youtube__
2. __Podcasts & Music__
3. __Chess__
4. __P*****b__
5. __Bitcoin News__
6. __General Societal News__
7. __Sports news__

These seven activities are steeling the most time in my daily life and prevent me from achieving success in my life. 

# The ideal Self
Following the [[Goals]] notes I have written I want to emphasise here the person I want to be in general in the coming year / years. 

An idealised version of me has the following schedule:

| Time | Activity | Electronics |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 6 AM | Wake up | No |
| 6:15 AM | Breakfast + Podcasts | No |
| 6:45 AM | Gym / Stretching Yoga | Yes |
| 8:30 AM | Shower | No |
| 9:00 AM | Deep Work Block I | No (except necessary) |
| 11:00 AM | Shake + Break | No |
| 1:00 PM | Lunch + Power Nap | No |
| 2:00 PM | Deep Work Block II | No |
| 7:00 PM | Reading / Podcasts / Chess | Yes |
| 8:00 PM | Dinner | No |
| 9:30 PM  | Sleep | No |
On this schedule I will work effectively 9 hours / day. 

# Known Distractions
For me known distractions are:
- __Youtube Videos on science related or trashy topics__
- __Porn due to bordem__
- __Podcasts__


 > The overarching issue is one of attempted multitasking driven by a need for stimulus. 
 
# Loopholes
I am able to block most of the distractions from my personal devices. But there are loopholes that need to be addressed. These are: 

1. __Sophies Phone__
2. __Caros Phone__ 
3. __Family Laptop__
4. __Other Public Laptops__

I will not be able to enforce a strict regime over these devices. So I will need a motivation and character-based approach to handling my behaviour around these devices.
