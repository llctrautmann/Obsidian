# What is Money?


I think money should be a tool to ease commerce between parties to make a modern a economy efficient. (Agree with Lyn)

Could there be a split between SoV and UoA, MoE? Could there be an indirect system, where we can store in one money and spend in another. 

I am also using bitcoin the wrong way and there is a divergence between what I would like bitcoin to be and what it is right now.

Is my making money on bitcoin a function of it being good? Maybe there is a fallacy that making money is falsely equated with being a good thing.  

> Jeff: The eurodollar system is a reaction to a tight/sound money system and I completely dominated the restricted Bretton Woods/Triffins Dilemma system. 

That is a point to think about.
