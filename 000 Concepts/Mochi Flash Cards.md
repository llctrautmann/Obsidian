# What are the two main interests in MRI?
Contrast and spatial resolution.
# What does signal intensity (SI) measure?
Signal intensity (SI) is what is being measured in MRI.
# What is required for specific elements to be measured in MRI?
An imbalance between protons and neutrons, requiring non-zero spin.
# Why is hydrogen the primary element used in MRI?
The body is mostly water, and hydrogen has a relatively strong NMR response, allowing for smaller signals to be measured.
# What causes an atom to behave like a little magnet?
Nuclear magnetism caused by its charge, which is a quantum phenomenon.
# How does the curl right hand rule relate to magnetic fields in MRI?
It shows that the magnetic field induces a current direction that is perpendicular to the spin direction.
# What happens to protons in the body when placed in a magnetic field?
Their chaotic arrangement leads to a combined magnitude of 0, but they align with the magnetic field, creating a net magnetization.
# What is the excess magnetism in a 1.5T magnet?
About 6 in 10,000 due to the applied magnetic field.
# What is spin angular momentum (SAM)?
A force proportional to mass, causing protons to rotate in a cone-shaped movement around their axis (precession).
# What is the formula for precession frequency?
$\\omega = \\gamma \\times B$ where B is the field strength and gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.
# What is the result of the application of a magnetic field on protons?
It causes precession, but the random precession leads to no net transverse magnetization.
# Why can't we measure the magnetization due to alignment?
Because the magnetic field creating it is much stronger, requiring manipulation to measure the net magnetization.
# What does Transverse Component Magnetization allow at high field strengths?
It allows synchronization of phase, leading to measurable magnetization that is not perfectly parallel to the input magnetic field.
# What is excitation in the context of MRI?
The addition of a radio signal that pushes magnetized particles into a transverse plane.
# What does resonance allow in MRI?
It allows energy to be added at the same frequency as the spins, defined by the Larmor frequency.
# What is the goal of adding energy through resonance in MRI?
To create a magnetization force that rotates perpendicular to the base magnetic field.
# How is the flip angle determined in MRI?
By how long the oscillating magnetic field (B1) is turned on.
