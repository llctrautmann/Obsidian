# RGB to HEX

- Divide each RGB value by 16 and note down the quotient and remainder.
- Convert the quotient and remainder into their corresponding hex values using the conversion table (0-9 and A-F).
- Concatenate the resulting hex values together, ensuring that each component is represented by two characters.
- Prefix the hex code with a pound sign (#) to indicate it is a hexadecimal color.
