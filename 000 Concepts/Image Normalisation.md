# Image Normalisation
When an image is transformed into a PyTorch tensor, the pixel values are scaled between 0.0 and 1.0. In PyTorch, this transformation can be done usingÂ **torchvision.transforms.ToTensor()**. It converts the PIL image with a pixel range of [0, 255] to a PyTorch FloatTensor of shape (C, H, W) with a range [0.0, 1.0].
