# Cleft Test
## Daily Productivity Summary

### Today's Achievements:
- Focused on developing a deep ensemble convolutional neural network model. The goal of this model is to upscale lower field MRI data into high-quality images that are on par with clinical-grade MRI. This task has been quite challenging.
- Dedicated a significant amount of time to familiarizing myself with the JAX library. I'm exploring its potential as a primary tool for my PhD project.

### Reflections:
- The process of integrating the JAX library into my project has been a learning curve. It's crucial to assess whether it's a viable option for the long term, especially considering the complexity of my project which involves enhancing MRI image quality.

### Tomorrow's Goals:
- Begin constructing the architecture for the training loop. This is a critical next step in advancing my project.
- Start identifying and collecting suitable data points. These will be essential for building a robust dataset, which in turn, will lay the groundwork for my project.

### Tools for Improvement:
- I'm considering using Cleft as an end-of-day summarization tool. It could be a valuable asset in helping me to summarize my daily work, highlight key points, and plan for the coming days more effectively.
