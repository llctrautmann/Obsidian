# PhD Workflow Concept
## Important Areas / Core Areas
- Coding 
- Reading literature
- Meetings
- Writing
- Communication


### Coding
- The main programming framework I will be working with will be jax and its derivatives for deep learning `Requires Setup/Preparation`
	- jax `Requires Setup/Preparation`
	- flax `Requires Setup/Preparation`
	- Optax `Requires Setup/Preparation`
- Daily Logging of code progress on Github
- Also include some free coding time for Rust and bash
- Include some coding meditations that solve some unrelated problem but bring joy for coding itself. 
- Detailed Data Versioning and Experiment Tracking with WandB `Requires Setup`
- Use Git in Repos according to industry standard `Requires Setup`
- 

### Reading
- 5 Research Paper / Week roughly 
- prioritise quality over speed
- Also include fundamental background research in Mathematics
	- M4ML
	- 

### Writing / Journal / Logging
- Summarise every day in detail to keep log
- Findings should not only be summarised but ideally already be restructured into paragraphs that can be plugged into papers
- Create a stack of paragraphs that function as a cache of ideas
- Meetings should be transcribed to maintain clarity
- blog:meansquarederror create PhD research section
- use public speaking opportunities

### Reviewing
- Extend daily / weekly / quarterly review to focus research direction

### Time Management
- implement a 10/50 mediation-work routine

### Health
- 3-4 time / week weight lifting
- 2 weekly cardio session
- stretching and meditation
- restrict alcohol and nicotine

### Communication
- Engage with PhD peers and participate in Events/Reading Clubs
- Engage with the UK research community across other research facilities to gain foothold. 

### Other things
- Automate as much as possible
	- Paper search
	- Meeting notes transcripts
	- 
- homogenise as many accounts as possible to simplify search
- Develop good labels for highlights 
- Reset and develop good keyboard shortcuts for faster work execution



# Model Schedule
### Monday to Friday Schedule

#### Morning Session (9:00 AM - 1:00 PM)
- **9:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Reading and Research**
  - Dedicated time for reading new papers, articles, and books. This includes both staying updated on the latest research in your field and deepening your understanding of foundational concepts.
- **11:00 AM - 1:00 PM: Coding**
  - Focused coding session. This could involve writing new code for your research projects, debugging, or refining existing models. Early in the week, this time might focus more on exploratory data analysis and model design, while later in the week could shift towards implementation and optimization.

#### Afternoon Session (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
- **2:00 PM - 4:00 PM: Coding (Continued)**
  - Continue the morning's coding tasks. This block can also be used for running experiments, training models, or analyzing results.
- **4:00 PM - 5:00 PM: Free Space**
  - This time is intentionally left open for meetings with your advisor, discussions with peers, attending seminars, or handling administrative tasks. It's also a buffer for when tasks from the morning or early afternoon overrun.
- **5:00 PM - 6:00 PM: Review and Plan**
  - End the day by reviewing what you've accomplished, noting down any issues or ideas to explore further. Plan the next day's tasks, prioritizing based on deadlines and progress.

### Weekly Overview

- **Total Reading and Research Time**: 10 hours
- **Total Coding Time**: 20 hours
- **Total Free Space Time**: 5 hours
- **Total Review and Planning Time**: 5 hours

### Additional Notes

- **Flexibility**: The "Free Space" time can be adjusted based on your weekly needs. If you find yourself needing more time for coding or reading in a particular week, you can reallocate time accordingly.
- **Breaks**: Make sure to take short breaks within each session to maintain productivity and avoid burnout.
- **Weekends**: Keep weekends flexible for additional reading, contemplation, or to catch up on work if necessary. However, try to reserve at least one full day for rest and activities unrelated to your PhD to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

This schedule is a starting point and should be adapted based on your personal working style, the specific demands of your research at different stages, and any teaching or additional responsibilities you may have.
