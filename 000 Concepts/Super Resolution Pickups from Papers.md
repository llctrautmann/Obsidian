# Super Resolution Pickups from Papers

Obtaining accurate, high-resolution MRI scans in paediatric populations is essential for studies of neurodevelopment and for diagnosis of neurological conditions (**Multi-orientation U-Net for Super-Resolution of Ultra-Low-Field Paediatric MRI, Baljer 2021**)
`How does this influence the shapes? Does that only mean we will have to use larger tensors?`

Visualisations of the loss surface indicate that skip connections facilitate smoother learning and faster convergence. (**The Problem Of Image Super-Resolution, Denoising And Some Image Restoration Methods In Deep Learning Models**, Giau 2024)
`I think these skip connections will be added into all the models I will want to work on.`
