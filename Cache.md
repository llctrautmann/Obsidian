>[!Bayesian Inference]
>Yes, that's a good summary of the process:
> 1. Choose a prior distribution for the model parameters.
> 2. Build a model (such as a neural network) to predict parameters of a parameterized distribution (e.g., mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution).
> 3. Use a method like variational inference or MCMC to approximate the posterior distribution over the parameters.
> 4. Train the model to fit the data well by maximizing the likelihood or a suitable objective function.
> 5. Once trained, sample from the posterior distribution to generate new instances or make predictions on unseen data.
> 
> This iterative process allows you to capture uncertainty in your model's predictions and generate realistic data samples.


Definition 2.18 (Coordinates). Consider a vector space $V$ and an ordered basis $B=\left(\boldsymbol{b}_1, \ldots, \boldsymbol{b}_n\right)$ of $V$. For any $\boldsymbol{x} \in V$ we obtain a unique representation (linear combination)
$$
\boldsymbol{x}=\alpha_1 \boldsymbol{b}_1+\ldots+\alpha_n \boldsymbol{b}_n
$$
of $\boldsymbol{x}$ with respect to $B$. Then $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$ are the coordinates of $\boldsymbol{x}$ with respect to $B$, and the vector
$$
\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha_1 \\
\vdots \\
\alpha_n
\end{array}\right] \in \mathbb{R}^n
$$
is the coordinate vector/coordinate representation of $\boldsymbol{x}$ with respect to the ordered basis $B$.
