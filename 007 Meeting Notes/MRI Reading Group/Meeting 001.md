# Meeting 001

Discussion revolved around the paper [[@liu2021]] on a novel low-field MRI scanner that does not require external radio-frequency shielding. Instead a CNN was used to calculate residual noise maps that mapped the radio-frequency noise in the total signal. 
- The approach is akin to ANC in headphones. 
- Requires a calibration phase for each room to assess the background RF and might therefore not be the ideal solution
	- _Issues have been raised with proprietary technology used in a different company low-field scanner, but that should not be an issue for experimental research_
- The CNN architecture needs to be evaluated further. Some aspects in the method section do not seem to be well thought u


Other issues that have been raised are the raised temperature in the bore that could be resulting from the
