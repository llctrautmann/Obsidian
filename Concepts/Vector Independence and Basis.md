# Vector Independence and Basis
[[Vector Spaces]] define the space-time continuum in which all other operations in machine learning occur. Individual vectors are capable of mapping the vector space either completely or only partially. The [[Null Space]] for example contains all the vectors within a vector space that are a solutions to $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. 

## Span

$$
\operatorname{span}\left\{\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n\right\}=\left\{\mathbf{v} \in V: \exists \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \text { such that } \alpha_1 \mathbf{v}_1+\cdots+\alpha_n \mathbf{v}_n=\mathbf{v}\right\}
