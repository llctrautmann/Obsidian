Hi. 

Today is not a good day. I have the globus melancholicus in my chest again. I feel like I am stuck in my life. I feel like I am not able to do anything useful. I feel like I am being left behind by everyone in my environment. Everyone is overachieving, everyone is happy in their life, everyone has a direction and a plan. I do not. I am stuck here. I have a collection of things I have done in my life but they feel disconnected and haphazard.
