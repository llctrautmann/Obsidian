# Likelihood
The first and most important choice in a Bayesian (or Frequentist) analysis is which probability model to use to describe a given process.

If the model choice is appropriate, we should be able to tune these parameters so that the modelâ€™s behaviour mimics the behaviour of the real-world system that we are investigating.

## What is a likelihood?
In all statistical inference, we use an idealised model to approximate a real-world process that interests us. This model is then used to test hypotheses about the world. 

In Bayesian statistics, the evidence for a particular hypothesis is summarised in a posterior probability distribution.
