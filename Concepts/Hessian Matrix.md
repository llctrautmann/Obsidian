# Hessian Matrix

The hessian is a concept in matrix calculus that is fundamental to the way machine learning is conducted in real world applications. The [[Hessian Matrix]] is important as such because it contains derivatives for vector functions. 


```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello World!")
}
```
