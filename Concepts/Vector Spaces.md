## Vector Spaces Basics
This is a vector:
$$
\mathbf{x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n 
\end{array}\right]
$$

a vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ looks like this:

$$\mathbf{x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
2 \\
3
\end{array}\right]$$


The two main operations for every vector space are addition and multiplication. Both are defined element-wise:

$$\large
\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1+y_1 \\
\vdots \\
x_n+y_n
\end{array}\right], \quad \alpha \mathbf{x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha x_1 \\
\vdots \\
\alpha x_n
\end{array}\right]
$$

## Necessary Conditions
There are six necessary conditions a vector space needs to conform to:

### Additive Identity

### Additive Inverse

### Multiplicative Identity

### Commutativity

### Associativity

### Distributivity


## Relevant Mathematical Background 
Generally, Vector spaces are an

> A vector space V is a set (the elements of which are called vectors) on which two operations are defined: vectors can be added together, and vectors can be multiplied by real numbers called scalars.
