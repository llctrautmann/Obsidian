# Range

the range of the linear map $T$ are all the vectors that I can reach with the linear map $T$. 


$$\large\tag{2}
\operatorname{range}(T)=\{\mathbf{w} \in W \mid \exists \mathbf{v} \in V \text { such that } T \mathbf{v}=\mathbf{w}\}
$$

`The range of T are those vectors w in the vector space W, for which exists a vector in V so that the equation Tv = w has a solution.`
