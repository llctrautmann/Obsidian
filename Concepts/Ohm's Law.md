# Ohm'sches Gesetz / Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage (\(V\)), current (\(I\)), and resistance (\(R\)) in an electrical circuit. The law is named after the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm.

## Mathematical Representation

Ohm's Law is mathematically expressed by the equation:

$$
V = I \cdot R
$$

where:
- \(V\) is the voltage across the conductor (measured in volts),
- \(I\) is the current flowing through the conductor (measured in amperes), and
- \(R\) is the resistance of the conductor (measured in ohms).

## Interpretation

- If voltage (\(V\)) is kept constant, an increase in resistance (\(R\)) will result in a decrease in current (\(I\)).
- If resistance (\(R\)) is constant, an increase in voltage (\(V\)) will lead to an increase in current (\(I\)).
- Ohm's Law is essential for understanding and predicting the behaviour of electrical circuits.

## Practical Applications

Ohm's Law is widely used in electrical engineering for circuit analysis, design, and troubleshooting. It provides a foundation for understanding the relationship between key electrical parameters and helps engineers and technicians optimise circuit performance.
