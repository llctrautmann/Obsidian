# Generalised Euclidean Space
The most important/used [[Vector Spaces]] is the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. Vectors in it are tuples with $n$ elements. 


$$\large
\mathbf{x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
2 \\
3
\end{array}\right]$$

More generally: 

$$\large
\mathbf{x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n 
\end{array}\right]$$
