# Null Space
Some important [[Subspaces]] are induced by linear maps. I assume $T: V \rightarrow W$ is a linear map here. Then, the null space is the subspace this contains all vectors that fall into $\mathbf{0}$ in the new vector space. More elegantly in mathematical notation:


$$\large\tag{1}
\operatorname{null}(T)=\{\mathbf{v} \in V \mid T \mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0}\}
$$
`The null space is all vectors in V that satisify the condition that the linear map V times the vector result in the zero vector.`
