# Hello World
All institutions have a lifetime and the death of any institution is always accopanied by a rise in the level of societal entropy. This can be entropy in a real world sense or entropy in on a cognitive level. In a real world sense, hightend senses of entropy materialise in civil unrest, societal polarisation and geopolitical tensions that cannot be buffered by existing institutions. Cognitive entropy can be seen in the creation of alternative ideologies (eco-chaimbers, sects, etc.) and a continuous decline in existing system players to cause declarations of confidence into the existing system. Most notably calls for unity being seen as either hollow or disingenious. Systems are the interplay of players and institutions within the system. And rising entropy is a sign that the current set of institutions are not able to exert the same amount of order as before. In the end all systems of control are brittle, and with enough entropy, the system breaks. The consequences of such a break are difficult to calculate.
