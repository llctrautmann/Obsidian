# Eurodollar System

Think about the global financial system as a collection of connected balance sheets. In this system, the most important factor is not loosing money and hence collateralising your investments this means that collateral is king. 

Since 2008 we live in a world with severely limited risk-taking appetite and flexibility in the system. A good analogy is a F1 racing tire. Pre-2008 the world was a functioning and well behaving F1 tire: flexible in its ability to create money where it is necessary. Since 2008, the global financial system is a tire that has exceeded the amount of heat that can be put through the tire. Meaning it is still a tire, but the performance is gone and the flexibility that used to be there is not there anymore.
