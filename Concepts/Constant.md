# Constant
Definition: A constant is a quantity which does not change and thus always has the same value. From a statistical perspective, a constant is a random variable which is equal to its expected value
$$
X=\mathrm{E}(X)
$$
or equivalently, whose variance is zero
$$
\operatorname{Var}(X)=0
$$]
