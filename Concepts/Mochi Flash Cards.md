# What is the relationship of a Distance and Metric in Lin. Alg?

Consider an inner product space $(V,\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle)$. Then
$$
d(x, y):=\|x-y\|=\sqrt{\langle x-y, x-y\rangle}
$$
This is called the distance between the vectors $x$ and $y$.

`Note: the distance is the norm between the difference between two vectors.`


# Define the Transpose of a Matrix
If $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, its transpose $\mathbf{A}^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ is given by $\left(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\right)_{i j}=A_{j i}$ for each $(i, j)$. In other words, the columns of $\mathbf{A}$ become the rows of $\mathbf{A}^{\top}$, and the rows of $\mathbf{A}$ become the columns of $\mathbf{A}^{\top}$.
