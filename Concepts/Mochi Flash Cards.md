# What is the relationship of a Distance and Metric in Lin. Alg?

Consider an inner product space $(V,\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle)$. Then
$$
d(x, y):=\|x-y\|=\sqrt{\langle x-y, x-y\rangle}
$$
This is called the distance between the vectors $x$ and $y$.

`Note: the distance is the norm between the difference between two vectors.`
