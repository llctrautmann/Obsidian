# Morphisms in Linear Algebra
In algebraic terms, a linear map is called a homomorphism of vector spaces. An invertible homomorphism (where the inverse is also a homomorphism) is called an isomorphism. 

`Think about loss of information; isomorphism means all data points are mapped uniquely, so no information is lost.`
