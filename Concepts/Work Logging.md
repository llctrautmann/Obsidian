# Work Logging
## ////////////////////////// 12-04-2024 //////////////////////////
### Code
- Understand the training loop code for the XOR problem in JAX 
- Shape matching for `jnp.array` tensors in JAX
- `params` in `pytree` structures in JAX

### Reading
- Vector Calculus Refresher for Vector functions in Machine Learning | [[Vector Calculus]]
- Random Number Generation in JAX | [[Pseudo Random Numbers in JAX]]

### Notes
- Initial Project structure will rely on simple DenseSR model with UQ for start and later upscaling
- Keep the Network Footprint small an scale complexity with increasing 
- DL Framework is set to JAX for rapid training
