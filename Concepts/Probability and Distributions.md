# Probability and Distributions
## Construction of a Probability Space
Probability aims at defining a mathematical structure to describe random outcomes of experiments. Using this mathematical structure of probability, the goal is to perform automated reasoning, and in this sense, probability generalizes logical reasoning.

Because it is not possible to perform some operation with boolean logic, probability theory can be considered a generalisation of Boolean logic. In the context of machine learning, it is often applied in this way to formalize the design of automated reasoning systems.

### Three basic claimes about probability
1. The degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers
2. These must be based on the rules of common sense
3. The resulting reasoning must be consistent with the three following meanings of the word "consistent"
