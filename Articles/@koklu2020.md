>[!Summary]+
>- The plant is sensitive to climate change.
>- New seed cultivars can increase resistance/tolerance to stress factors.
>- Seed characteristics can be determined to increase resistance/tolerance.
>- Physical features of dry beans (appearance, size, colour) increase the market value
>- The study aims to provide a method for obtaining uniform seed varieties from population production.

Resistance and/or tolerance to plant stress factors may be increased by breeding of new seed cultivars and determination of the seed characteristics ([Koklu and Ozkan, 2020, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/NFMG7M37))

Dry beans are sensitive to the effects of changing climate. Artificially breading new stains of dry beans might be a valuable strategy to increase plant robustness. 


> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WY5Z3VPS?page=1&annotation=F78U7BWK)The presentation of products of dry beans determined by physical features such as appearance, size, color, internal health and diversity increases the market value. ([Koklu and Ozkan, 2020, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/NFMG7M37))

The market value of dry beans is determined by different features of the bean, such as size and colour.

([Koklu and Ozkan, 2020, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/NFMG7M37))

This study provides a method for generating uniform seed varieties that could be valuable in industrial production applications.
