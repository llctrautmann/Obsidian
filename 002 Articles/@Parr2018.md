> > we really need general rules for the derivative of a function with respect to a vector and even rules for the derivative of a vector-valued function with respect to a vector.

> > You can think of d dx as an operator that maps a function of one parameter to another function. That means that d dx f (x) maps f (x) to its derivative with respect to x, which is the same thing as df (x) dx . 

> [!PDF|yellow] [[parr2018.pdf#page=5&selection=423,2,436,3&color=yellow|parr2018, p.5]]
> > We compute derivatives with respect to one variable (parameter) at a time, giving us two different partial derivatives for this twoparameter function (one for x and one for y). 

> [!PDF|yellow] [[parr2018.pdf#page=6&selection=192,0,198,37&color=yellow|parr2018, p.6]]
> > So the gradient of f (x, y) is simply a vector of its partials.

> > Gradient vectors organize all of the partial derivatives for a specific scalar function. If we have two functions, we can also organize their gradients into a matrix by stacking the gradients. When we do so, we get the Jacobian matrix

> >  That is a generally useful trick: Reduce vector expressions down to a set of scalar expressions and then take all of the partials, combining the results appropriately into vectors and matrices at the end.

> > ortunately the Jacobian is very often a diagonal matrix, a matrix that is zero everywhere but the diagonal

> > Under what conditions are those off-diagonal elements zero? Precisely when fi and gi are contants with respect to wj , âˆ‚ âˆ‚wj fi(w) = âˆ‚ âˆ‚wj gi(x) = 0. Regardless of the operator, if those partial derivatives go to zero, the operation goes to zero, 0 Â© 0 = 0 no matter what, and the partial derivative of a constant is zero.
