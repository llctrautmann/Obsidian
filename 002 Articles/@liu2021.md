## Introduction

> In the past two years, intensive ULF MRI developments using permanent magnets (homogenous Halbach 0.05 T 19,20 , double-pole 0.05 T 21 , and rotating inhomogeneous Halbach 0.08 T22 ) are promising. Their results suggest the possibility of generating brain images with low-cost hardware, though the imaging versatility and image quality remain unknown.

> In this study, we report the development and initial clinical demonstration of a permanent magnet-based, low-cost, lowpower, and shielding-free brain ULF MRI scanner. Specifically, we first designed our system around the framework of a homogeneous 0.055 T permanent double-pole magnet and linear imaging gradients. This configuration allows us to form images with various universally adopted contrasts and flexible orientations for clinical brain imaging, including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) like and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).

> Second, we developed a deep learning driven EMI cancellation technique to model, predict and robustly remove the external and internal EMI signals from MRI signals, thus eliminating the traditional RF shielding cage.

> we succeeded in implementing the four essential protocols on this low-cost prototype scanner for clinical brain MRI, namely, T1-weighted (T1W), T2-weighted (T2W), FLAIR-like, and DWI with isotropic diffusion weighting

## Results

> compared with high-field images, less gray matter and white matter contrast was observed in these T1W, FLAIR and DWI images, likely because of decreased gray and white matter contrast, increased noise level and strong partial volume effect associated with large voxel size at 0.055 T.

## Challenges
> ([[liu2021.pdf#page=11&selection=47,2,54,65&color=yellow|liu2021, p.11]])
> Key technical challenges in ULF MRI are the adequate image SNR, contrast, and resolution achievable within a reasonable scan time. At present, though partly alleviated by increased acquisition efficiency due to generally shorter T1 values, image SNR, contrast, and resolution at 0.055 T may be still too low for robust clinical applications.

> we can exploit omnipresent mutual anatomical features across human brains. Conventional MRI data acquisition and image reconstruction procedures do not utilize any prior information on human anatomy. Thus, the genetically pre-defined and highly homogenized human brain anatomical information has been completely neglected in past MRI formation process, yet it can be potentially utilized to intelligently drive and drastically enhance MRI data acquisition, image reconstruction, and clinical utility to expedite MRI scan and tackle the low SNR challenge at ULF
