> > Uncertainty Estimation (or Uncertainty Quantification) of deep networks, as one key of trustworthy AI, refers to the process of predicting the uncertainty or confidence of a neural networkâ€™s predictions [9]â€“[11]. Since it allows us to quantify the reliability of the networkâ€™s output and to identify when the network may not be performing well.
