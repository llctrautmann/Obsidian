# Summary
> [!summary]+
> The article by Eldridge and Kiefer (2018) discusses the emerging science of ecoacoustics, which investigates and interprets the ecological role of sound. This involves examining sonically-mediated relationships between human beings and their environments, a field known as acoustic ecology. Despite the increasing interest in this area across ecological science, arts, and humanities, there are still no coherent theories to frame the ecological role of the soundscape or to elucidate the evolutionary processes through which it is structured.
> 
> Ecoacoustics differs from soundscape ecology in that it investigates the role of sound at higher ecological and evolutionary organisational units - from population and community up to landscape scales. Sound is seen as a core ecological component and an indicator of ecological status.
> 
> The authors propose two models of the acoustic niche hypothesis, which are demonstrated to exhibit the emergence of complex spectro-temporal soundscape structures and adaptation to and recovery from noise pollution events. This hypothesis expands upon the ecological niche concept by adding a sonic dimension to evolutionary ecospace.
> 
> However, the development and application of ecoacoustics is hindered by a lack of coherent theories and computational tools, as well as the difficulty of defining and measuring ecological integrity and biodiversity. The authors suggest that these challenges could potentially be addressed through the use of Synthetic Acoustic Ecology (SAC), a sonically situated approach using agent-based evolutionary systems with implicit fitness through competition for resources.
> 
> The authors also note the potential of cross-disciplinary interactions, as software models can draw upon insights from experimental music and machine listening research to develop ecological applications and feedback into creative practice. The acoustic environment is a shared, finite resource, implying that relationships within it are at best neutral and generally competitive. This calls for a shift from bioacoustic investigation of individual communication to understanding the complex dynamics of acoustic communities, which ecoacoustics aims to achieve.

([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Nevertheless, there are currently no comprehensive theories that encompass the ecological importance of the soundscape or the evolutionary processes shaping it. (Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 2)


> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=2&annotation=YF45PNW7) As a first step, two simple models of the acoustic niche hypothesis are presented which are shown to exhibit emergence of complex spectro-temporal soundscape structures and adaptation to and recovery from noise pollution events. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Eldridge and Kiefer propose two models to establish a first modelling approach for the acoustic niech hypothesis. Both were able to show the emergence of complex spectro-temporal soundscape structures and were able to adapt if interfered by external and foreign noise.

([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Various fields, including ecological science, arts, and humanities, are showing a growing curiosity in studying and understanding the soundscape, which bridges human and natural worlds.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=2&annotation=ZS5YKEZV) However, there is a paucity (scarcity) of coherent theory addressing the ecological significance of the global soundscape, lack of effective computational tools for ecological monitoring (Sueur et al., 2008) and many latent creative applications, for example in musical composition or game world design. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Despite the interest, there's a shortage of unified theories on the ecological importance of soundscapes, a lack of advanced monitoring tools, and untapped potential in creative fields like music and gaming.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=2&annotation=WZPFD9JQ) we propose that a sonically situated flavour of Alife, which we call Synthetic Acoustic Ecology (SAC), may be a productive vehicle for investigation and a nexus of exchange between the scientific, artistic and technological facets of acoustic ecology. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

We suggest that a specific approach named Synthetic Acoustic Ecology (SAC) can be a valuable tool for research and a bridge connecting the scientific, artistic, and technological aspects of acoustic ecology.

The term 'soundscape' is employed by different fields to explain the connection between a location and its auditory elements in both tangible and digital realms.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=2&annotation=C8RNK2U6) Within the scientific discipline of soundscape ecology a framework has been proposed to investigate soundscape in terms of the causes and consequences of the biological (biophony), geophysical (geophony), and human-produced (anthrophony) sounds that emanate from a landscape ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

In soundscape ecology, there's a suggested framework to study the origins and effects of sounds from biological, geophysical, and human sources in a given environment.

([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Ecoacoustics delves into the ecological significance of sound, examining it from individual populations to broader landscape levels.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=3&annotation=XLC9JQV2) Sound is understood as a core ecological component (resource) and ipso facto, due to structuring by competition, an indicator of ecological status (source of information). ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Sound is seen as a fundamental ecological element and, because of its competitive nature, it serves as a gauge for ecological health.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=3&annotation=7ULIG9PC) Ecoacoustics is born of Bioacoustic Big Data, but lacks coherent theories and computational tools for effective development and application. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Ecoacoustics, originating from extensive Bioacoustic data, is still in need of unified theories and efficient computational tools for its growth and use.

Bioacoustics adopts the morphological adaptation hypothesis (MAH) and the acoustic adaptation hypothesis (AAH) to explain the evolution of signals due to ecological influences.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=3&annotation=WHSVM532) the acoustic niche hypothesis is core to ecoacoustics (and is also the hardest to evaluate) and describes the evolution of soundscape complexity ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

The acoustic niche hypothesis, fundamental to ecoacoustics and challenging to assess, explains the progression of soundscape intricacy.

Bernie Krause, a musician turned bioacoustician, in his ANH concept, highlighted that both physical and behavioral changes can be influenced by interference between species when their calls share frequency and timing similarities.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=3&annotation=7SXNJPZJ) The ANH was inspired by observation of complex arrangements of dense, non-overlapping signals in recordings of soundscapes across multiple pristine habitats. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

The ANH was influenced by the observation of intricate patterns of distinct, non-overlapping signals in soundscapes from various untouched habitats.

Reduce overlaps in sound frequencies or timings between different species' vocalizations.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=3&annotation=9YZIB4GL) The ANH expands Hutchinson’s ecological niche concept (Hutchinson, 1957), which is foundational to modern ecology, by adding a sonic dimension to evolutionary ecospace. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX)

The ANH extends Hutchinson’s ecological niche idea by introducing a sonic perspective to the evolutionary environment.

In tropical ecosystems, different species, including frogs, often have distinct frequency ranges for their calls.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=3&annotation=49HZCJC5) The more significant and controversial prediction follows that soundscape structure is a proxy for ecological integrity: less-disturbed habitats with unaltered species assemblages will exhibit higher levels of coordination between interspecific vocalizations than more heavily disturbed habitats, where species assemblages are in rapid flux ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX)

A bold and debated prediction is that the structure of a soundscape can indicate ecological health: undisturbed habitats with stable species will show more coordinated vocalizations compared to disturbed areas with fluctuating species.

By listening attentively, we can gauge an ecosystem's health.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=3&annotation=JVE7STR2) empirical validation and development of application is hard: firstly because it is not clear exactly what it means for a soundscape to exhibit ‘higher levels of coordination’; secondly because measurement of ecological integrity and even biodiversity remains contentious ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Validating this theory and its applications is challenging: it's unclear what "higher levels of coordination" in a soundscape means, and measuring ecological health and biodiversity is still debated.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=3&annotation=35L7P2R4) thirdly we lack appropriate computational methods for community-level machine listening ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

We currently don't have the computational methods needed for community-level machine listening.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=4&annotation=UT27JA7Q) Thus empirical theory testing is hampered by lack of requisite computational technology, but computational development requires clearer conceptual models and empirical methods. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX)

Testing theories empirically is hindered by the absence of necessary computational technology, but developing this technology requires clearer models and methods.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=4&annotation=Y6FT6NFB) Earlier work in Alife and sonic ecosystems (McCormack, 2003) demonstrated the artistic potential of agent based evolutionary systems with implicit fitness through competition for resources, eliminating the fitness bottleneck of more conventional evolutionary models. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Previous research in Alife and sonic ecosystems showcased the artistic potential of agent-based evolutionary systems that compete for resources, bypassing the limitations of traditional evolutionary models.

The potential to deepen our understanding of the relationship between soundscapes, agents, and their environment is evident but remains untapped.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=4&annotation=3B9GCKUZ) Rich cross-disciplinary interactions are afforded as software models can productively draw upon insights from generative experimental music and machine listening research to both develop ecological applications and in turn to feed back into creative practice. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Software models can benefit from insights from generative music and machine listening research, which can then influence both ecological applications and artistic practices.

([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Ecoacoustics aims to transition from studying individual communication in bioacoustics to understanding the intricate dynamics of acoustic communities.

The acoustic environment is a shared resource, leading to neutral or competitive relationships, especially when organisms' calls overlap in frequency and timing.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=4&annotation=8HFG88SL) The aim of model 1 was to establish the minimal conditions for the emergence of spectrotemporal partitioning through low level agent-environment competitive interactions. Model 2 investigated the impact of adding greater variation in range of temporal and frequency vocalisation parameters on the complexity of agent calling behaviours and emergent soundscape structure; the response of the population to externally induced environmental sound, simulating noise pollution, was also investigated. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Model 1 aimed to determine the basic conditions for the emergence of sound partitioning through agent-environment competition. Model 2 explored the effects of varying vocalization parameters on soundscape structure and how populations respond to external noise.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=4&annotation=IIIGN2ZB) The basic premise of the acoustic niche hypothesis was tested: that interference from heterospecific signals will result in spectro-temporal partitioning of the shared acoustic environment. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

The fundamental idea of the acoustic niche hypothesis was tested, suggesting that interference from different species' signals will lead to partitioning of the shared acoustic space.

In our models, both the 'sender' and 'receiver' roles in bioacoustics are combined into a single, asexual entity.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=6&annotation=VAHSTV9H) Spectrograms for both models (figures 2, 3) show soundscapes that evolve distinct frequency bands with simple temporal patterns emerging. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX)

Spectrograms from both models display evolving soundscapes with distinct frequency bands and emerging temporal patterns.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=6&annotation=PIEC79Q6) Both also show population recovery following simulated noise pollution: agents in mid to lower frequency bands die out due to masking from white noise; the population gradually recovers to create a soundscape exhibiting full-range spatio-temporal structures ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX)

Both models also show that populations can recover after being exposed to simulated noise pollution, with agents in certain frequency bands dying off and then the population gradually recovering.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=6&annotation=UF47GXKB) Our toy models demonstrate that spectro-temporal partitioning, creating structured global soundscapes, emerges readily from sonically situated agent-environment interactions. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

Our basic models show that structured global soundscapes can emerge from interactions between agents and their sonic environment.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=6&annotation=UK7UQ52H) That small increases in vocalising and listening capacities lead to quite significant increases in soundscape variation lends credence to this line of enquiry, suggesting that it may scale to ecologically and musically more interesting situations. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

The fact that minor enhancements in vocalizing and listening capacities lead to notable increases in soundscape diversity supports this research direction, hinting that it might be applicable to more complex ecological and musical scenarios.

A more advanced model would allow for more complex vocalizations and would include agent memory for asynchronous communication behaviors.

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNZRKMYW?page=7&annotation=L9VT3SIJ) The models do however capture the core characteristics of spectro-temporal soundscape partitioning, and SE and LZC metrics show a formation of structure, laying the ground for more rigorous work in SAC in the future. ([Eldridge and Kiefer, 2018, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/WESCKYFX))

While our models capture the essential features of soundscape partitioning, metrics like SE and LZC show the formation of structure, setting the stage for more detailed Synthetic Acoustic Ecology research in the future.
