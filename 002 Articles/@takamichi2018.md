> This paper proposes phase reconstruction from amplitude spectrograms based on the von-Mises-distribution DNN. The von Mises distribution is a probability distribution on the circle [13], which is suitable for modeling periodic variables. The von-Mises-distribution DNN is a generative model that has the von Mises distribution as a conditional probability distribution.

> The loss function for DNN training, named the phase loss (see Fig. 1), is defined by minimizing likelihoods of the von Mises distribution. Also, we propose another loss function named group-delay loss, which has a stronger connection to the amplitude spectrum
