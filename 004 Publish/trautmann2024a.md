# Why US Government Debt (Still) Does Not Matter
I think many people are misunderstanding why the US government is able to continuously issue large amounts of debt without being punished for it. 


Since 2007 the world is living with a perpetual lack of high-quality collateral. This issue has not been resolved since. 

There exist only limited information on tri-party Repo and even less information/statistical data on bilateral bespoke repo transactions. 

In sum, this should explain why the US government debt does not matter as of right now. We are still living in a collateral-based system, in which US government debt - and here especially on-the-run treasuries - are not valuable because they yield the buyers some amount of coupon. US debt is simply necessary in a risk-averse system lacking hq collateral. Everybody in the system needs collateral for their funding purposes.
