# The deficiencies of Proof-of-Stake
All arguments against Proof-of-Stake and why it is necessary to secure a decentralised network with a real "unforgeable costliness". 



## Many-Blockchains attack
Without an unforgeable costliness, it will be possible to create an infinite amount of histories without any real-world cost. 


## Perpetual Stake
If you own 51% of the network stake, you own the network permanently. There is no mechanism in place to let the network heal by itself. It is just game over. 

## Computational Complexity


## Memory and Bandwidth
