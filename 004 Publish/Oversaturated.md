# Oversaturated
We are all oversaturated. I don't want this to sound like a desire to bring the past back, and I don't want this to sound like any complaint about the restlessness of our time. But there is some correlation between dissatisfaction with the world and the speed at which we push content into our cerebral cortex. This is my observation of my behaviour, but I feel more and more that I am yearning for something meaningful in the world when interacting with the barrage of content flooding my life online and offline. It is all just a bit too much of everything all at once. 

More and more, when I watch content on YouTube, read the news, or search the web, it feels like I am no longer paying attention to the information propagated to me. It becomes watching for the sake of watching. It becomes a constant clicking between content, home, content, new content, recommended content, shorts, home, and old content. It's incoherent; my attention is jumpy and scattered. And all of it at 1.5-2.0x the speed of the original video. It is the atomisation of the mind. Our attention is fundamentally what we are. So what happens if we pulverise our attention to the singular unit? What are we under these circumstances?

We are all oversaturated. Too much of everything leads to no capacity to feel anything meaningful anymore. We should change, but I don't think there is any interest in changing the times of the attention economy. I don't want to make the argument that it all boils down to money and profit. The people working at these large tech companies are equally trapped in this conundrum. But I also don't think that this will be possible to go on forever. At some point, something will happen that brings a change. I don't know when this will be. But if the past is any guide, I don't think it will be a gradual process. So it is probably something to brace for.
