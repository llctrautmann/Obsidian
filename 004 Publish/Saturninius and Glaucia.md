# Learnings from the End of a Republic
I have a fable for the Roman Republic. Rome was one of the most interesting political constitutions in the history of humanity and the history of the republic and the empire both hold many lessons that can be useful to this day. That said,
one of the best books that I have read on Rome in the last years is _The storm before the storm: The beginning of the end of the roman republic_ by Mike Duncan. [I want to use this post to highlight three things to look out for today that have played out before in the late republic] that I think are worth paying attention for. 

A small disclaimer: There are of course major differences between the late republic and today. I am aware of them. Advances in technology have made our time more interconnected. Nuclear weapons have introduced the potential of world-ending destruction. War is not a valid tool of politics anymore. However, I do not think that these differences matter, with respect to the observations I want to outline here. My focus is on the threats to cohesion through politics and politics is still running mostly on ancient hardware (i.e. us humans). For the purposes of this text I will also minimise the roll of social media. I will pretend that both in Rome and today we had a systems of information distribution with elements and interconnections that influenced decision-making and that these two are therefore comparable. 

## Saturninius and Glaucia: the firebrands


## Destruction at all costs


## Violence
I initially wrote this before the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. Originally, I intended to write about the theoretical risk of violence. Sadly, someone tried to convert theory into practice. 


Dawwwwwwwwwwg!
