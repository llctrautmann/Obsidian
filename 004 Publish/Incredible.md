# Incredible
In a recent blog post, I touched on the issues the modern tech world is creating for our attention. I want to add another point that is the worst evil: the evaporation of believability in today's social media-driven world. 

I have observed this in myself, but this is the same for you: Social media has elevated showiness to such a level that it makes virtually everything someone does in public unbelievable. The equation is simple: it is meaningless if a camera is involved somewhere. The camera makes all the difference here.

I want to explain this with an example: there are many, many homeless people in the world, and it is genuinely an excellent deed to spend some of your wealth on them to make their life a bit easier. But you can give away 100, 1000, or a million grilled cheese sandwiches for a youtube video, the entire charity goes down the drain. It is now a form of narcissistic poverty voyeurism - oh and a homeless man gets a grilled sandwich as a side note. It's sickening. This mechanism is on repeat everywhere (e.g. Je suis Charlie Hebdo, I stand with Ukraine, insert public outcry campaign of the last decade). And it devalues their meaning to the point where they are meaningless to 99% of all people.

I don't believe in any public messaging anymore. Everything is plastic. Everything is fake. You see general discussions on the question, "Why is there such cynicism in the Western world?". The simple answer is that how we spend our attention and the constant affirmation people seek on social media leads to this cynicism. The outside is all shiny, bubbly and perfect, but the inside is driven by vanity and greed, and after a while, it becomes glaringly apparent that all of it is bullshit. The really sad thing here is that we need these campaigns. There are social issues that need to be addressed. But we won't be able to tackle anything if every cause immediately loses all its credibility when it is posted on social media.
