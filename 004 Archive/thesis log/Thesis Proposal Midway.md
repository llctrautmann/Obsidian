# Thesis Proposal Midway
## Objectives
- Phase reconstruction of STFT has been notoriously difficult in the literature.
- This Thesis attempts to use an unsupervised architecture to reconstruct the magnitude and phase component of the input magnitude and phase spectrogram.
- The result of the dissertation project will be a reconstruction of the magnitude and phase components that can then be fed into an inverted short-time Fourier transform to produce audible files. 
## Metrics
- Griffith Lim as a baseline
## Model Architectures

## Resources
