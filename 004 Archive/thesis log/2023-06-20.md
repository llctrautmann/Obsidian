# Report
## Achievements
Today we had the fourth meeting in the thesis project. In the meeting I presented the encoder model that I have constructed over the past week and we discussed the problem that I have spotted in the paper ([[nugraha2019.pdf]] ) and potential mitigations:

These points were:
- the somewhat bewildering decision to crop the samples in the paper figures to a range
- Issues with the loss function and the von Mises distribution
- The strange single axis convolutions (the proposed solution of a (2 x 1) kernel for a 2D convolution to avoid having to switch around the dimensions in the encoder has not worked unfortunately)

I have also worked a bit on understanding the temporal block in the decoder, which is the only piece of the puzzle that I have not been able to decipher completely as of right now. 

## Difficulties
The biggest difficulty right now is the temporal block in the decoder. I need to understand the architecture of the block to the point that I can implement something that makes sense and that allows me to train the magnitude for now and then see how I can improve on the model to also reconstruct the phase. 

## Things to Remember
- none today, due to little work
