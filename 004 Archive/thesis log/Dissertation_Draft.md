# Introduction
## Background
Through out the last century technological advances have transformed more and more of the worlds biotopes whether on land due to urban development, on sea due to commercial shipping or in the atmosphere due to increases in aviation [cite]. The expansion of the "_anthropotope_" has lead to grave disruptions in the functioning of ecosystems in all three aforementioned domains. In light of these disruptions, fundamental changes in the treatment of the environment have to be implemented globally within the coming years to prevent a permanent and catastrophic destruction of the worlds biodiversity, habitable zones, and food supply  among others. The general public and the scientific community are broadly aware of the most well-known, human-made causes of changes in the earths biosphere. Most prominent are the increases in the concentration of green-house gases in the atmosphere which have lead to increases of 1 degree Celcius in the global average temperature over since the beginning of the 20th century. 


While in the past the damages to the planets ecosystems have been disproportionally been felt by animals and people living in the global south, recently, the effects have increasingly been felt on all parts of the globe. Over the last decade, wild fires of previously unheard of sizes have wreaked havoc on parts of Canada, the US, and southern and central Europe. 

The resounding majority of the data indicates that the destruction of the ecosystems is not only progressing, but increasing in speed. 

One aspect of the expansion of human influences on the environment are less well-known forms of pollution, such as light pollution
