# Report
## Achievements
The only achievement as such that I was able to complete today was to marginally organise the repo and get the stray files out of the repo and everything in the repo labelled correctly. 


## Difficulties
Today was a very unrewarding day. I couldn't make any progress on the model or the data. The model is still bottlenecked by the lack of information on the Temporal Block dimensionality issue. I just cannot for the life of me figure out what I should do and what the correct dimensions are/ I do know what the correct dimensions are but I don't know how to implement this in pytorch so that I can get the right dimension out of the transformation. I have sent the original author an email but I am pretty sure that I will not be getting an answer from him in the next days/weeks and by then it will be a bit too late for my dissertation. Anyways, other than than I couldn't find the data repo and it was just all in all a very unrewarding day. 



## Things to Remember
- Find out what the data is. 
- Find out what the temporal block is. 

## Tasks
- [x] Find out what the data is ðŸ“… 2023-06-22 âœ… 2023-06-25
- [x] Talk to Kieran and Ivor about the temporal block ðŸ“… 2023-06-22 âœ… 2023-06-25
- [x] Create an appropriate data pipeline ðŸ“… 2023-07-01 âœ… 2023-07-04
- [x] Research more possible ways to reconstruct the phase from the magnitude ðŸ“… 2023-06-20 âœ… 2023-06-26
