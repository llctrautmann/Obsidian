## Achievements
Today I was able to get a working training loop for the magnitude reconstruction to work ðŸŽ‰. I have run however, into a weird memory issue with PyTorch on mac, that makes my computer use about a gazillion gigs of RAM. So this is something to optimise in the future (hopefully by tomorrow). I am also rebuilding the repo because I want to have not this weird overlap with the other venv. I don't know where exactly the confusion in VSCode comes from, but I starting a complete new project is probably not the worst idea for this stage of the project, now that I have a working alpha model.

## Difficulties
- The memory thing is the biggest issue
- No update on the temporal block so far, maybe tomorrow
