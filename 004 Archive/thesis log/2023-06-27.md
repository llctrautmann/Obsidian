## Achievements
Today was a productive day over all. I will have to pivot course a bit and change my approach to the dissertation work, but I am glad I got it out of the way and now I can move forward with the work. If everything goes wrong, I will still be able to defer the dissertation to a later date and complete it in the coming six months in Amsterdam.
On the technical side I got to finish my dataloader in pytorch and will work with torchaudio in the future of the project just to keep everything nice and simple and within the same framework. My current plan now looks like follows. My baseline will be the phase estimation with the Griffith Lim Algorithm. All my ML approaches should at least be better than the Griffith Lim  approach. As next steps I will focus on the phase estimation and then hopefully in a last step I will be able to build a gen model that can do both the phase estimation and the magnitude estimation in one swoop. 

## Difficulties
- I had to change the model an I am now effectively back at square 1 but with more experience
- My eyes and my brain are killing me at the moment, i need to do more time off screen. 
- No gym today
- No meditation today



## Things to Remember
