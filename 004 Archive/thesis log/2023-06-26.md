## Achievements
Today I was able to get a simple training loop up and running and managed to refactor the progress I have made so far in the project into python files. I now have a pipeline for the audio file preprocessing, all the necessary blocks built that have been referenced in the paper, as well as a training loop and a visualisation function that will allow me to see what my model is doing. I think the hard part is starting now. 


## Difficulties
I will have to do more work on the architecture in the future as the model I am building now is not really capable of doing anything useful besides creating shades on a canvas that resemble the input shades. I also need to speed up my work. I am not quite sure what I am doing at the moment and I feel like I need a better plan an a more concrete structure to go forward so that I can complete the thesis in time and get an acceptable result. I have almost spent 50% of the time and I am nowhere near any acceptable alpha model. I don't want to stress to much about it, but I need to put my foot down and work harder.
