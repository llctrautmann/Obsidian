## Research Paper: A Multi-habitat, Comparative Evaluation of Ecoacoustic Indices for Biodiversity Monitoring: Acoustic Indices Predict Avian Species Richness in Temperate but not Tropical Habitats

**Authors:** Mika Peck

**Abstract:**
- The paper investigates the relationship between avian species diversity and various acoustic indices across different ecological conditions.
- Acoustic surveys were conducted in temperate and tropical habitats in the UK and Ecuador.
- 26 acoustic indices were calculated and compared to observed variations in species diversity.
- Five acoustic diversity indices (Bioacoustic Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Acoustic Evenness Index, Acoustic Entropy, and Normalised Difference Sound Index) were assessed, along with three simple acoustic descriptors (root-mean-square, spectral centroid, and zero-crossing rate).
- Significant correlations, up to 65%, were observed between acoustic indices and avian species richness in temperate habitats where a single vocal taxon dominates.
- Weaker correlations were observed in neotropical habitats hosting multiple non-avian vocalizing species.
- Multivariate analyses suggest that acoustic indices also track habitat-dependent community composition, with each habitat having a distinct soundscape.
- Compound indices were found to be more powerful predictors of avian species richness than any single index, and simple descriptors contributed to predicting avian diversity in multi-taxa tropical environments.
- Community level acoustic indices are proposed as a proxy for species richness and for tracking habitat-dependent changes in community composition.

**Sampling Methods:**
- Acoustic surveys were conducted along a habitat degradation gradient (forested, regenerating forest, and agricultural land) in SE England and NW Ecuador.
- Six sites were sampled consecutively from May 6th to Aug 25th, 2015 (UK1, UK2, UK3, EC1, EC2, EC3).
- The UK sites were located in Sussex, SE England, consisting of ancient woodland (UK1), regenerating farmland with patches of woodland (UK2), and a downland barley farm (UK3).
- 1-minute mono audio recordings were made every 15 minutes at three different habitats in the UK.
- Ten-day acoustic surveys were conducted at each site using 15 Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter audio field recorders.
- Sampling points were arranged in a grid at a minimum distance of 200 m to minimize pseudo replication.
- Altitudinal range of sample points across sites was minimized to prevent confounding gradients (UK: 10 m – 50 m, Ecuador: 130 m – 390 m).
- Recording schedules captured 1 minute every 15 minutes around the clock for 10 days at each site, resulting in 960 recordings at each of the 15 sample points for 3 habitat types in 2 different climates (86,400 1-minute recordings in total).
- Data across the 15 sample points were pooled, and inter-site variation was not explored in the current analyses.
- In the UK, 3½ hours of each dawn chorus was sampled starting 1 hour before sunrise to capture the onset, progression, and peak of the dawn chorus.
- The equatorial dawn chorus was more compact and sampled for 2¼ hours starting 15 minutes before sunrise, capturing a comparable chorus onset and peak.

Note: This is a summary of the main facts from the research paper "A Multi-habitat, Comparative Evaluation of Ecoacoustic Indices for Biodiversity Monitoring: Acoustic Indices Predict Avian Species Richness in Temperate but not Tropical Habitats" authored by Mika Peck. The paper discusses the evaluation of acoustic indices in biodiversity monitoring across different habitats and climates in the UK and Ecuador, providing valuable insights for automated acoustic monitoring and ecological studies.
