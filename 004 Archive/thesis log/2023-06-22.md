## Achievements
I have now implemented the VAE model without the temporal block. I want to see whether the model can accurately (or semi accurately at least) reconstruct the magnitude spectrogram. I also got back from the researcher and he will share his insights into the code with me hopefully by the beginning of next week. That will be awesome. I wll have to use the weekend to update and work on my intro a bit to understand what the field is on about in general.



## Difficulties
- None really today, except general ineffectiveness in my work 



## Things to Remember
- None
