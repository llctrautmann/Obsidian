# Make AIAS great again
To whom it may concern: 

My name is Luca Trautmann, and I have been a student in the Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems MSc for the past academic year. I am writing this letter to you, the representatives and responsible authorities at the informatics department, because there needs to be a change implemented in the curriculum and the assessment of students.  

## Fraud Prevention in times of GPT
The assessment structures in the department invite fraud at every turn and recent experiences I and other students and teaching assistants had at this university make it borderline necessary to also commit fraud to stay competitive. I will not single out students here, but there are confirmed cases of students paying for courseworks, and massive collusion on exams and coursework. In addition, these issues have been flagged in some cases to the responsible lecturers and there have been no consequences due to the resource requirements that an investigation would take. Students have paid 22000 pounds for the opportunity to study at a upper tier university in the UK and they do expect that academic standards are being followed and enforced. We believe that these improvements would constitute a meaningful improvement:
1) All exams should be conducted in-person and on campus
2) Courseworks and exams should be in general be converted to longer form individual projects or vivas that require the student to present some of his work and then answer questions on the work

Academic fraud is a global problem and other universities will have the same complaints but there are solutions and it is time that these solutions are implemented.

## The timeliness of the curriculum
The most glaring issue with the program is the outdatedness of the curriculum. Artificial Intelligence has changed a lot in the past decades, and the curriculum does not reflect these changes. Most interesting innovation and industry applications in the field have machine learning at their core. However, machine learning is woefully underrepresented in the curriculum. There are also many redundancies in the modules that cut the amount of taught content even further. The course contents need to be streamlined more and they need to be brought into the year 2023. As such we are proposing the following changes to the program: 

1) Introduction of pre-requisites in the form of an entrance exam or similar assessment to confirm prospective students have the necessary mathematical background and python programming experience to allow for the teaching of graduate level content
2) The entire program should be based around machine learning, which should be reflected in the appropriate modules in the fall term and spring term 
3) Creation of two or more fixed tracks that reflect the universities research directions (NLP, Bio-Inspired AI, etc.) with modules that build on top of each other to prevent redundancies (e.g. Alife and Intelligence in Animals and Machines should be combined into one module)
4) Introduction of a module that teaches students the extra-academic skills necessary for the job as a data scientist/ML engineer (e.g. SQL, MLflow, FastAPI/pydantic)

At last, I think this university has great potential and could offer a very compelling package for students interested in AI. Sussex will not be able to compete with the big names like Oxford, Cambridge, UCL or Imperial on a name basis. But this should be an motivation to create a course that shines through the quality of the education that is being offered. If the University would create a curriculum that is at the cutting edge of current trends of AI, it would create a great incentive for students to come here. But - ironically given the name of the course - the curriculum is not adapting with the changes in the real world and this will make this programme feel more and more like a cash grab and not like quality education. 

Judging from the feedback I have received from other students, many of us will remember Sussex as a nice place to live but not as a place of top-notch education. We believe that this is a real shame and something that need not to be.  As it stands today I will not recommend anyone I know to come here. It is just not worth it. I can only speak for myself here, but if the university wants to create a dialogue with their former students to improve the program, I would be more than happy to participate in these discussions. The current students will not gain anything from changes to this program, but we want to be able to recommend this university to future generations. 

Sincerely, 

Luca Trautmann
