Bending Spoons

To whom it may concern / Dear Recruiting Officer, 

As a soon to graduate Masters in Artificial Intelligence, I have spent the past several years building up my expertise in generative machine learning and data science more broadly. As Bending Spoons looks to grow its operations in its AI department, I would be thrilled to help the company grow and achieve its goals. 

As you can see from my CV, my undergraduate training has been in Psychology and not a technical field such as Computer Science or Engineering. During my final year as an undergraduate student I read about the threat of synthetic media to society and I became increasingly interested in the technology behind it. In particular, I became interested in generative AI. After my graduation, I pivoted my life and set out to becoming a part of the generative AI community. I enrolled for a data science pre-master program at the University of Amsterdam to extend my data science skillset beyond the techniques I have learned doing social science research and learn how to program. I then applied to graduate programs in Europe and the UK and got accepted into the Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems program at the University of Sussex.  The program extended my skillset in general machine learning techniques and the underlying mathematical foundations. However, it is my dissertation project on phase spectrogram reconstruction with generative AI, that confirmed my strong dedication to generative AI. Over the past months, I have been working with different generative machine learning architectures to recreate sound signals form incomplete data. This project taught me a lot about AI and I galvanised my dedication to machine learning and generative AI. 

I started in 2021 with a dream to work in a generative AI company in the future and I want to the take the next step and fulfill me that dream by working for Bending Spoon as an AI Software engineer. I believe that I am the right candidate for the position because I have extensive experience in Python, and am well versed in PyTorch for deep learning, which fits well with the companies technology stack. I can also work with SQL databases as well as FastAPI and Hopsworks for serverless model deployment. As a passionate ML engineer, I want to take the first steps in my career with a fast growing and agile company and I would love to contribute to the success of Bending Spoons. I bring with me both communication skills acquired in Psychology undergraduate degree, as well as technical expertise that I have gained throughout my past graduate education. 

I have pivoted in my education because I did not want to spend my life in a field that I do not enjoy. I understand that, this has left me with little work experience within data science as of right now but I am a dedicated to learner and I will be able to adapt to the challenges of the job quickly. I admire Bending Spoons' dedication to data-informed product building - especially their generative AI -  and would be thrilled to join the AI team. However, I am in principle also open for other positions if they are a good fit for me. I have attached my resume, which further outlines my education, experiences and projects. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I appreciate your time and consideration and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely, 

Luca Trautmann

Dear Recruiting Officer,

As a soon-to-graduate Master's student in Artificial Intelligence, I have dedicated the past several years to building up my expertise in generative machine learning and data science more broadly. I am excited to express my strong interest in joining Bending Spoons and contributing to the growth and success of the company's AI department.

While my undergraduate training focused on Psychology, I discovered my passion for technology during my final year when I learned about the potential impact of synthetic media on society. This led me to become increasingly interested in the technology behind it, particularly generative AI. After graduation, I decided to pivot my career and immerse myself in the generative AI community. To bolster my technical skills, I enrolled in a data science pre-master program at the University of Amsterdam, where I extended my knowledge beyond social science research techniques and learned programming. Subsequently, I pursued a graduate program in Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems at the University of Sussex. This program expanded my expertise in general machine learning techniques and the underlying mathematical foundations. However, it was my dissertation project on phase spectrogram reconstruction with generative AI that solidified my dedication to generative AI. Over the past months, I have been working with different generative machine learning architectures to recreate sound signals from incomplete data, and this project further galvanized my passion for machine learning and generative AI. I am now ready to take the next step.

I started my journey in 2021 with a dream of working in a generative AI company, and I am eager to take the next step and fulfill that dream by working for Bending Spoons as an AI Software Engineer. I believe that I am the right candidate for the position, as I possess extensive experience in Python and am well-versed in PyTorch for deep learning, which perfectly aligns with the company's technology stack. Additionally, I am proficient in working with SQL databases as well as FastAPI and Hopsworks for serverless model deployment. As a passionate ML engineer, I am determined to take the first steps in my career with a fast-growing and agile company like Bending Spoons, where I can make meaningful contributions to its success. My background in Psychology has equipped me with strong communication skills, which complement the technical expertise gained throughout my past graduate education.

Although my pivot in education has limited my work experience in data science, I am a dedicated learner and confident in my ability to adapt quickly to the challenges of the job. I will work hard and proof that I am the right person for the job. I deeply admire Bending Spoons' dedication to data-informed product building, especially in the realm of generative AI, and I would be thrilled to join the AI team. Nevertheless, I am also open to exploring other positions if they are a good fit for my skillset. For a comprehensive overview of my education, experiences, and projects, I have attached my resume.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Luca Trautmann
