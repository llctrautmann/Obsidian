# Distraction from Failure
Do I not do the things I want to do consistently because procrastination holds me in a place of perpetual non-failure? I don't succeed but I also haven't failed. It's a Schr√∂dingersque moment. 

How do I get the focus, commitment and determination to become satisfied with my work and life?
