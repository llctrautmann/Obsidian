# Thoughts against PoS
This is a collection of thoughts and reasons why proof of stake is not a good system - regardless of what people online are trying to tell you:

## Perpetual Stake
In Proof-of-Stake staking rewards are being distributed to "stakers" based off the amount of stake they have. This immediately leads to a big problem. Like a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor (think Chernobyl) has an accelerated feedback loop that pushes it towards an uncontrolled state (think violent spontaneous disintegraton), PoS systems have a tendency towards a oligopolic system where the largest holder will increase their stake over time. This makes them more likely to rake in new rewards, increase their stake, rake in more, et cetera; you get the picture. 

## Hostile Takeover Risk

The premine gave early investors 72 Million ETH (with the distribution being unknown; Lubin comment to bot buy / hide multiple buy orders). Now there are 120 Million ETH in circulation. This has become more of a problem as Proof-of-Stake has make the key factor the stake not the accumulated work. With Proof-of-Stake the amount of stake you hold gives you more power over the network.
