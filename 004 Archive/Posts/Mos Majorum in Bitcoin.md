# The relationship between Mos Maiorum and The Social Layer in Bitcoin and Ethereum

> _[O tempora, o mores!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_tempora,_o_mores!)_


Once you delve into Bitcoin you quickly bump into highly interesting social dynamics.

As a decentralised network, Bitcoin has necessarily a social component. 

After all, while the code might not be high-jacked, the people running the code can clearly be influenced to change/adapt/modify/alter/damage the underlying code. 
`A good thing to add here would be the block size wars`

In a recent episode on Ethereum's monetary policy David and Ryan from Bankless described Bitcoin's monetary policy as fixed, while Ethereum's monetary policy as more malleable. 
`This point is the key point I want to relate to Mos Maiorum and why this "adaptability" is actually more of an issue than the two hosts think.`

In their podcast they define the social dynamics layer as the layer 0. I want to stick to the terminology. 

I personally think that understanding concepts that are hard to grasp can be made easier if they are observed from a more relatable angle. Humans are exceptionally good at understanding social situations and hence I think it is advantageous to look at the issue of fixed vs. floating monetary policy and the layer 0 from a social dynamics angle. 

What I will do in the coming paragraphs is related the discussions that are occurring on the layer 0 to the history of the demise of the roman republic to show that there are advantages to the ossification of the Bitcoin consensus rule set and that there are risks that should not be downplayed in the approach that Ethereum has taken. 

Everything I say here is not new and has been laid-out by people before. But I want to use this new angle to potentially make certain aspects of the dilemma more tangible for readers. 

## A Brief History of The Roman Republic
To begin I want to set the stage so people understand where we are. The roman republic can be broadly situated between the expulsion of the last of the seven kings of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus, in 509 BC and the conversion of the republic into an empire under Gaius Julius Caesar and ultimately Augustus in 27 BC. 

That gives us about 480 years in total to play with, but I will focus mainly on the latter years of the timespan because that is the most relevant to the discussion I want to kindle with this essay. 

Mos Maiorum can be loosely translated into 'The way of the elders'. 

It was an unwritten code that guided the behaviour of Roman citizens in the Republic and regulated the *dos* and *dont's* in the political life of the citizens. Mos Maiorum stood as a fundamental principles of the Republic and guided the behaviour of the system of government over centuries. It set guardrails that protected the state from being attacked from within by enforcing norms that forbid certain actions on the social consensus layer. 

As such it was a guarantee of stability as it set a framework that every player in the network - regardless of influence and status - needed to adhere to. 
`This is a major point and I want to set this in contrast to the work of ETH FOUND and key players in the system of ETH`

As with all generalised social norms, the consistency of mos maiorum through time also created a reinforcement loop that engrained mos maiorum into society with each day that passed without infringement. 
`However it also had the adverse affect when rules were broken. This is an incentive mechanism that also plays out in Bitcoin. We had the blocksize war and upheld Mos Maiorum, Ethereum had the DAO hack and tore down Mos Maiorum.`



Arguably, the collapse of the _mos maiorum_ was partly responsible for the major catastrophe besetting ancient Rome that ultimately sealed the fate of the roman republic: the bloody civil war between Gaius Marius, Sulla, Sinna and their respective factions that led to the beginning of the end for the Republic.

So what happened? 
`Not sure if a detailed deconstruction of the events is necessary, but I might want to add it later for context.`

### Consequences of the Breakdown of Mos Maiorum in the Republic
Unwritten rules like Mos Maiorum need to be protected otherwise they loose their effectiveness. 2000 years ago the gradual breach of more and more of these unwritten rules ultimately destabilised the system to the point of catastrophic failure. From the brief history outlined above two main consequences can be drawn:

1. Breaking mos maiorum can have catastrophic consequences but these consequences do not need to be immediate visible 
2. Due to the risk of (1) infringements of mos maiorum by participants need to be  rigorously and immediately contested  
3. Due to (2) members of the society need to understand their role in protecting the network and in the value of the rules. 

## Mos Maiorum in Bitcoin
So what is Bitcoins Mos Maiorum? I think it can be reduced down to a simple set of unwritten but stringently enforced layer 0 rules. In my view there are three major unwritten rules that should not be touched, if you ask Bitcoiners. I have listed them in order of "undebatableness": 

1. 21 Million Bitcoin is the hard cap
2. To maintain decentralisation, nodes are the enforcement layer of the consensus which requires
	1. sub clause 1: 1 Mb blocksize limit
	2. sub clause 2: low bandwidth requirements
	3. sub clause 3: low hardware spec requirements
3. Single function use (Bitcoin as a form of hard money) with very timid additions

I understand that these are not strictly unwritten but also embedded in the code, but on the social layer these are the most defended positions and the point of this essay is an argument about the social layer / layer 0. Code can be changed so these rules are enforced in the minds of Bitcoiners that run nodes and without the conviction of the node runners on the layer 0 the code is meaningless.  

## Attacks on Bitcoin's Mos Maiorum 
As has been seen 2000 years ago in the Roman Empire, the tenets of mos maiorum can come under attack and with enough pressure can be broken. Similarly, today in Bitcoin, because these laws are not enforced by an authority, as Bitcoin is a decentralised network -digitally as well as socially - the current rules of mos maiorum also have come under attack. 

The most famous attack in the history of Bitcoin were the blocksize wars of 2017. I will give a brief summary here but BitMex Research have written a book of this period in Bitcoin, that I highly recommend people [read](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-blocksize-war/). 

Very briefly, due to rising transaction fees on `mainnet` in 2017 a group of exchanges and large companies in the bitcoin space decided in 2017 to propose a hardfork for bitcoin that would increase the blocksize limit. This ran contrarian to the idea of nodes requirements being manageable for everyone to run and ran into stiff opposition with the community. Despite the pushback the changes were proposed in a hardfork anyways but the community voted with their nodes and rejected the proposal, thereby preserving mos maiorum and rebuffing large and well-funded players in the industry. 
`This needs to be corrected for erros and fleshed out. `
`We had the blocksize war and upheld Mos Maiorum, Ethereum had the DAO hack and tore down Mos Maiorum.`

More recently, the development and purposeful exploit of a bug in the taproot Softfork through ordinals constitute another attack on mos maiorum in bitcoin. 

Similarly, the well meaning but also more engineering driven improvement proposals to add all manner of new functionality into bitcoins core code also constitute a softening of some of the core tenets of mos maiorum. 


## Ethereum
I think the first blow to the Mos maiorum of Ethereum was the DAO hack and the subsequent actions that have been taken by the Ethereum foundation to roll back the chain and reverse the history. 
` We had the blocksize war and upheld Mos Maiorum, Ethereum had the DAO hack and tore down Mos Maiorum.`
