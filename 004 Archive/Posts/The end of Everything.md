# Gaga-Land

What will be the end of everything? From my view on society as a whole at the moment, the end of everything will be some sort of entertainment heat death. Let me explain what I mean by this. It appears, that what society values (measured in the attention and resources that are being deployed) the most at the moment are the collective death of as many cognitive abilities as possible at the same time and across all relevant age groups. 

Children, teenagers and young adolecents loose the will to live due to complete morphing with their phones and the endless stream of low-quality bullshit that is being precision-injected into their cortex by recommendation algorithms. We have by now witnesses everything. Harmless, loss of dignity occurs when someone glued to their screen mindlessly walks into a lamp post or glass door. More concerning are violence against teachers when phones are being taken away form teenagers in school. Most concerning and and out-right collapse of any sense of dignity are examples like self-promotion instagram posts from the inside of cremation oven in Auschwitz. Yes, these are not the norm (yet), but we are moving at breakneck speed to gaga-land aka. a mixture of Fahrenheit 451, 1984, A brave new world and Mr. Robot. The new currency of the land is now attention, if you like it or not can be deemed irrelevant; the future is non-negotiable. 

Another interesting observation from the outskirts of gaga-land is the complete irrelevance of actual quality. I remember a debate Germany, whether certain shows on television, require labelling as a (long german word incoming) _Dauerwerbesendung_ to prevent (another german word) _Schleichwerbung_. These innocent looking words mean a tv program with constant advertisement and product placement or hidden advertisement (literally sneak advertisement). Back then there the affected tv shows complained and protested, presumably fearing declining revenue due being labeled lower quality. That was in 2009 and I think it is fair to say these times are over. We are now in gaga-land and in gaga-land being authentic is what matters. And as a consequence quality is not important anymore. So now we value low-budget, direct influencing. Whether it is YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, doesn't matter. The paradigm is everywhere the same: You don't need any talent or skill except having enough of a pulse to hold something in your phone camera and talk. The addictiveness of the medium will do the rest for you. 

What worries me is the future. The next 100 years will not be calm or easy-going. We will need good ideas, good leaders and there are going to be tough choices ahead of us. I am not sure that the inhabitants of gaga-land will not lead us into total chaos. 


## Main Points
- we make our children sick and sad, to the point where they attempt to kill themselves
- Low quality is the new good, cause it is authentic
- LLM and AI will make us skill-less until they break and the we destroyed all knowledge
