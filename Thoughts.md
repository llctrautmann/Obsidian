>  Democracy as a political system works best with a limited and gatekept information sphere and a high information travel time. 


>  High information fragmentation, similar to high representation fragmentation (5% hurdle) degrades the democratic process. 


> Only the private sector has come up with innovation is a harmful myth. 
> - Arpanet 
> - Investments in goods that cannot be commercialised well initially, have high upfront cost, but high general utility 


> Losing track of the money supply is central banking original sin. 


> There is a mismatch between global problems and a species, that is incapable of species-level empathy. 


> The highest valued commodities of the near future will be trust and privacy. 


> Th brain’s killer app is induction from sparse data. The internet creates an information sphere that the diametrical opposite of homo sapiens’ adapted specialty. This leads to information overload and is a serious threat to human survival. 


> The most impressive achievement of natural evolution is energy efficiency. Its difficult to make something fly, its really difficult to make something fly on 350kcal. 


> Energy abundance in the most general sense [calories, electricity, mental capacities, effort] is the most important factor in long-term survival of individuals and societies. 


> AGI, will be the next humiliation of mankind. Gallilei removed homo sapiens from the centre of the universe. Darwin broke the illusion of being the prime species. AGI will remove the mantle of most cognitively adaptable. How we handle the change will reveal a lot about the progress we have made since our evolution started. 


> The biggest thing Satoshi ever did, was to not commercialise Bitcoin. Some things are necessary but cannot produce revenue without corrupting them. For example, we need internet search. But search alone is not profitable. 


> What would be a break even price for a google subscription, to maintain all its services but remove the entire advertisement component? 


> The biggest similarity between Trump
> and Hilter is their stupidity and contemporary media talent. 


> Bracelet: Am I in orbit of some one or something? 


> Making money is being equated to being good or doing good. This can be seen everywhere: Crypto, Decreasing the industrial base of a country (e.g. US). But just because you make money does not mean that the thing is good/solid/sound or the right way to design a system. 

> The broken monetary system has lead to a broken social contract. 

> All institutions have a lifetime and the death of any institution is always accompanied by a rise in the level of societal entropy. This can be entropy in a real world sense or entropy in on a cognitive level. In a real world sense, hightened senses of entropy materialise in civil unrest, societal polarisation and geopolitical tensions that cannot be buffered by existing institutions. Cognitive entropy can be seen in the creation of alternative ideologies (eco-chaimbers, sects, etc.) and a continuous decline in existing system players to cause declarations of confidence into the existing system. Most notably calls for unity being seen as either hollow or disingenuous. Systems are the interplay of players and institutions within the system. And rising entropy is a sign that the current set of institutions are not able to exert the same amount of order as before. In the end all systems of control are brittle, and with enough entropy, the system breaks. The consequences of such a break are difficult to calculate.
